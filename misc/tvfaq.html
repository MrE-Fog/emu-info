<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3><a name="tvtatc">Television at the crossroads</a></h3>

Television in substantially its present form has been with us for nearly
50 years.  It is a tribute to the National Television Standards Committee
(NTSC) that the color television standards agreed upon in the early 1950s
have performed remarkably well making quite efficient use of valuable radio
spectrum space and the psychovisual characteristics of the human eye-brain
system.  However, HDTV (High Definition TV) will supplant and ultimately
replace the current standards.  We will all come to expect its superior
resolution, freedom from noise and ghosting, and pure CD sound.  Yet,
the perceived quality of TV broadcasts and cable will never likely be the major
issue with most consumers.  Content will continue to be the biggest problem.
<p>
As of June 2009, all analog broadcasting in the USA has been discontinued by
law, except for some low power local transmissions.  This (so the justification
goes) frees up a large amount of electromagnetic spectrum for other
(more lucrative!) applications, since the Digital TV (DTV) channels occupy less
bandwidth.  Low cost DTV converter boxes enabled existing TVs to receive
the digital signals so there was no need to buy new digital TVs, though
this did make for one darn good excuse to upgrade to a 60" flat
screen HDTV! :)
</p><p>
There is plenty of information available elsewhere with regard
to the pros and cons of the DTV conversion, the trials and tribulations of
people using antennas (as opposed to cable or optical fiber), and the ultimate
benefits, real and perceived.  Suffice it to say that when digital reception
is good, the picture and sound are very very
good and there is essentially no comparison with the analog system it replaced.
This is true even when a converter box is used with an analog TV in good
condition and standard definition digital is better than
the best analog.  HDTV with multi-channel sound is simply exquisite.
</p><p>
However, unlike analog TV, poor reception doesn't result in snow or ghosts,
but rather the picture (and sound) totally drops out or (in the case of the
video) freezes or pixilates.  For over-the-air reception, the type of
antenna and its orientation becomes much more critical.  And even in areas
close to the transmitter, local terrain and obstructions in the line-of-sight
like hills and buildings may result in problems.

</p><h3><a name="tvrfcvf">Television receiver fundamentals</a></h3>

The basic color television receiver must perform the same functions today as
40 years ago.  (Since B/W is a subset of the color standard, most references
in this document will be for color except as noted).  A studio video monitor 
includes all of the functions of a television receiver except the tuner
and IF (which rarely fail except for bad connections or perhaps lightning
strikes to the antenna or cable connection).  Therefore most
of the repair information in this document is applicable to both TVs and
studio monitors.  Modern computer monitors share many similarities with
TVs but the multisync and high scan rate deflection circuitry and more
sophisticated power supplies complicates their servicing.
<p>
As of this writing, the majority of TVs are still based on the Cathode
Ray Tube (CRT) as the display device.  Tiny pocket sets, camcorder
viewfinders, and the like have started using LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
panels but these are still inferior to the CRT for real time video.
There has always been talk of 'the picture on the wall' display and these
are now appearing as large screen plasma panel displys but their cost is
still high compared to even projection TVs using CRTs.  The reason
is simple economics - it is really hard to beat the simplicity of the
shadow mask CRT.  Of course, prices will drop as the technology matures.
</p><p>
Projection - large screen - TVs, on the other hand, are able to take
advantage of a novel development in integrated micromachining - the
Texas Instruments Inc. Digital Micromirror Device (DMD), now called DLP
for "Digital Light Processing".  This is basically
an integrated circuit with a tiltable micromirror for each pixel fabricated
on top of a static memory - RAM - cell.  This technology would
permit nearly any size projection display to be produced and would
therefore be applicable to HDTV.  Since it is a reflective device, the
light source can be as bright as needed.  This technology is already appearing
in commercial high performance projectors and is competing for use in
totally digital movie theaters to replace the film projector and has
begun appearing in high-end consumer projection TV sets - yet.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
 (From: Kurk MacKay (kurk_mackay@telus.net).)
<p>
"DMD TVs have been on the marketplace for about a year now.  The DMD is more
 commonly referred to as DLP (Digital Light Processing) in the marketplace.
 From what I've heard Samsung has had a DLP TV on the consumer marketplace
 as of last year in the US and this year here in Canada.  My boss was
 looking at buying one so we went around to view them.  The picture quality
 looks to be between the LCD projection and Plasma.  I believe the current
 Samsung uses a color wheel but they are working on a three color
 independent system.
</p><p>
 For more info or if you want to buy one, see
 <a href="http://www.dlptvshowcase.com/">DLP TV Showcase</a>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As noted, the plasma panel flat screen display has been around for several
years in high-end TVs, typically in the 42 inch diagonal range.  However,
they are very expensive ($5,000 to $15,000 as of Winter, 2003), and their
life expectancy may be limited due to the gradual degradation of the active
pixel cells - which occurs faster than for a CRT.  The physical resolution
is also still low enough that visible discrete pixels may be objectionable
to some viewers.  However, there is little doubt that this or a similar
technology will eventually replace the direct view CRT and 3-tube projection
TVs in the mid to large screen sizes in the not too distant future.
</p><p>
The remainder of this document concentrates on CRT based analog TVs since
these still dominate the market and realistically, these are the only type
where there is a good chance of repair without access to specialized test
equipment and parts.  I wouldn't recommend any sort of
attempt at repair of flat screen TVs or monitors - no matter what the size -
beyond checking for bad connections, dead power supplies, or other obvious
problems.  The chance of success is vanishingly small and it's very likely
that even with great care, damage could occur to the panels or circuitry.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvrep">TV repair</a></h3>

Unlike VCRs or CD players where any disasters are likely to only affect
your pocketbook, TVs can be dangerous.  Read, understand, and follow the
set of safety guidelines provided later in this section whenever working
on TVs, monitors, or other similar high voltage equipment.
<p>
If you do go inside, beware: line voltage (on large caps) and high voltage
(on CRT) for long after the plug is pulled.  There is the added danger of
CRT implosion for carelessly dropped tools and often sharp sheetmetal
shields which can injure if you should have a reflex reaction upon touching
something you should not touch.  In inside of a TV or monitor is no place
for the careless or naive.
</p><p>
Having said that, a basic knowledge of how a TV set works and what can
go wrong can be of great value even if you do not attempt the repair yourself. 
It will enable you to intelligently deal with the service technician.  You
will be more likely to be able to recognize if you are being taken for a ride
by a dishonest or just plain incompetent repair center.  For example, a
faulty picture tube CANNOT be the cause of a color television only displaying
shows in black-and-white.  The majority of consumers probably do not know even
this simple fact.  Such a problem is usually due to a bad capacitor or other
10 cent part.
</p><p>
This document will provide you with the knowledge to deal with a large
percentage of the problems you are likely to encounter with your TVs.
It will enable you to diagnose problems and in many cases, correct them
as well.  With minor exceptions, specific manufacturers and models
will not be covered as there are so many variations that such a treatment would
require a huge and very detailed text.  Rather, the most common problems
will be addressed and enough basic principles of operation will be provided
to enable you to narrow the problem down and likely determine a course of
action for repair.  In many cases, you will be able to do what is required
for a fraction of the cost that would be charged by a repair center.
</p><p>
Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a great
deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant information
if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair.  It will also be easier to do
further research using a repair text such as the ones listed at the end of
this document.  In any case, you will have the satisfaction of knowing you
did as much as you could before taking it in for professional repair.
With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will not
easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

</p><h3><a name="tvreprep">Repair or replace</a></h3>

If you need to send or take the TV to a service center, the repair
could easily exceed half the cost of a new TV.  Service centers
may charge up to $50 or more for providing an initial estimate of repair
costs but this will usually be credited toward the total cost of the repair
(of course, they may just jack this up to compensate for their bench time).
<p>
TV prices have been dropping almost as fast as PC prices.  Therefore, paying
such prices for repair just may not make sense.  Except for picture tube
problems, most TV faults can be corrected without expensive parts, however.
Keeping a 5 year old TV alive may be well worthwhile as basic TV performance
and important features have not changed in a long time.
</p><p>
If you can do the repairs yourself, the equation changes dramatically as
your parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge
and of course your time is free.  The educational aspects may also be
appealing.  You will learn a lot in the process.  Thus, it may make sense
to repair that old clunker for your game room or beach house.  (I would
suggest the kid's room but most TV watching just rots the brain anyhow so
a broken TV may be more worthwhile educationally than one that works.)

<h2>TV Receivers 101</h2>
<h3><a name="tvsubs">Subsystems of a television set</a></h3>

A TV set includes the following functional blocks:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Low voltage power supply (some may also be part of (2).)  Most of the lower
 voltages used in the TV may be derived from the horizontal deflection
 circuits.  Sometimes, there is a separate switching power supply but
 this would be the exception.  Rectifier/filter capacitor/regulator from AC
 line provides the B+ to the switching power supply or horizontal
 deflection system.  Degauss operates off of the line whenever power is
 turned on (after having been off for a few minutes) to demagnetize the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal deflection.  These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
 sweep the electron beam in the CRT across and back some 15,734 times
 per second (for NTSC).  The horizontal sync pulse from the sync separator
 locks the horizontal deflection to the video signal.
<p>
</p></li><li>Vertical deflection.  These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
 sweep the electron beam in the CRT from top to bottom and back 60 times
 per second (for NTSC).  The vertical sync pulse from the sync separator
 locks the vertical deflection to the video signal.
<p>
</p></li><li>CRT high voltage (also part of (2).)  A modern color CRT requires
 up to 30 kV for a crisp bright picture.  Rather than having a totally
 separate power supply, nearly every TV on the planet derives the HV
 (as well as many other voltages) from the horizontal deflection using
 a special transformer called a 'flyback' or 'Line OutPut Transformer (LOPT)
 for those of you on the other side of the lake.
<p>
</p></li><li>Tuner, IF, AGC, video and audio demodulators.  Input is the antenna or
 cable signal and output are baseband video and audio signals.  There is
 usually someplace inside the TV where line level video and audio are
 present but it may not be accessible from the outside of the cabinet
 unless you paid for the more expensive model with the A/V option. 
 Very often, the tuner is a shielded metal box positioned on the bottom
 right (as viewed from the front) separate from the main circuit board.
 Sometimes it is on the main circuit board.  The IF section may be in
 either place.
<p>
 On older or cheap TVs with a knob tuner, this is usually mounted to the
 front panel by itself.  There are usually separate boxes for the VHF and
 UHF tuners.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Chroma demodulator.  Input is the baseband video signal.  Outputs are
 the individual signals for the red, green, and blue video to the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Video drivers (RGB).  These are almost always located on a little
 circuit board plugged directly onto the neck of the CRT.  They boost
 the output of the chroma demodulator to the hundred volts or so needed
 to drive the cathodes of the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Sync separator.  Input is baseband video.  Output is horizontal and
 vertical sync pulses to control the deflection circuits.
<p>
</p></li><li>Audio amplifier/output.  The line level audio is amplified to drive
 a set of speakers.  If this is a stereo TV, then these circuits must
 also perform the stereo demultiplexing.
<p>
</p></li><li>System control.  Most modern TVs actually use a microcontroller - a fixed
 program microcomputer to perform all user interface and control functions
 from the front panel and remote control.  These are becoming increasingly
 sophisticated.  However, they do not fail often.  Older TVs use a bunch
 of knobs and switches and these are prone to wear and dirt.
</li></ol>
<p>
Most problems occur in the horizontal deflection and power supply sections.
These run at relatively high power levels and some components run hot.
The high voltage section is prone to breakdown and arcing as a result
of hairline cracks, humidity, dirt, etc.
</p><p>
The tuner components are usually quite reliable unless the antenna experiences
a lightning strike.  However, it seems that even after 20+ years of
solid state TVs, manufacturers still cannot reliably solder the tuner
connectors and shields so that bad solder connections in these areas are
common even in new sets.

</p><h3><a name="tvprojtv">Why projection TVs are not just normal TVs in big boxes</a></h3>

In order to achieve the necessary brightness with a large display format,
three separate monochrome CRTs are used with optics to combine the three images
properly at the screen.  This creates an entire set of additional problems in
design.
<p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).) 
</p><p>
The average projection TV has about twice as many parts as its direct-view
counterpart.  Some of the extra parts are essential for projection because CRT
projection tubes require dynamic convergence. The other extra parts have to do
with the fact that a more expensive TV also should have some extra features,
like Dolby ProLogic sound, a satellite tuner and such.
</p><p>
Generally, the electronics are based on a standard chassis that is also used
for direct-view CRT television. Even the deflection circuits require minor
adaptations at most. The high-voltage circuit is different because the EHT,
focus and G2 voltages must be distributed over 3 CRTs. So this requires a
special high-voltage part, which also includes an EHT capacitor and bleeder.
</p><p>
There will be 3 CRT panels with video amplifiers.  Because of the extremely
high brightness, projection tubes will burn the phosphor screen immediately in
fault conditions so a protection circuit is essential.
</p><p>
And last but certainly not least, there is the dynamic convergence panel. The
heart is a waveform generator IC, often of a Japanese brand but nowadays
there's also a digital variant by Philips. The old-fashioned way requires many
many potentiometers to program the waveforms. Then there's 5 or 6 convergence
amplifiers and a corresponding extra power supply. And usually this is where
the single deflection circuits are distributed to the 3 CRTs.  At the same
time the deflection currents are sensed for the protection circuits.
</p><p>
Designing a PTV from a DVTV requires several man-years of work. In the
factory, a special corner is devoted to the assembly. There you'll find
specially educated people and the speed of the assembly line is a lot lower
than usual. It requires many more adjustments, e.g. 3 optical and 3 electrical
focus adjustments and then convergence.

<h3><a name="tvonline">On-line tech-tips databases</a></h3>

A number of organizations have compiled databases covering thousands of common
problems with VCRs, TVs, computer monitors, and other electronic equipment.
Most charge for their information but a few, accessible via the Internet, are
either free or have a very minimal monthly or per-case fee.  In other cases, a
limited but still useful subset of the for-fee database is freely available.
<p>
A tech-tips database is a collection of problems and solutions accumulated by
the organization providing the information or other sources based on actual
repair experiences and case histories.  Since the identical failures often
occur at some point in a large percentage of a given model or product line,
checking out a tech-tips database may quickly identify your problem and
solution.
</p><p>
In that case, you can greatly simplify your troubleshooting or at least
confirm a diagnosis before ordering parts.  My only reservation with respect
to tech-tips databases in general - this has nothing to do with any one in
particular - is that symptoms can sometimes be deceiving and a solution that
works in one instance may not apply to your specific problem.  Therefore,
an understanding of the hows and whys of the equipment along with some good
old fashioned testing is highly desirable to minimize the risk of replacing
parts that turn out not to be bad.
</p><p>
The other disadvantage - at least from one point of view - is that you do not
learn much by just following a procedure developed by others.  There is no
explanation of how the original diagnosis was determined or what may have
caused the failure in the first place.  Nor is there likely to be any list
of other components that may have been affected by overstress and may fail
in the future.  Replacing Q701 and C725 may get your equipment going again
but this will not help you to repair a different model in the future.

<h2>CRT Basics</h2>

Note: Most of the information on TV and monitor CRT construction, operation,
interference and other problems. has been moved to the document:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/crtfaq.htm">TV and Monitor CRT (Picture Tube) Information</a>.
The following is just a brief introduction with instructions on degaussing.

<h3><a name="tvccrtssa">Color CRTs - shadow masks and aperture grills</a></h3>

All color CRTs utilize a shadow mask or aperture grill a fraction of an
inch (1/2" typical) behind the phosphor screen to direct the electron beams 
for the red, green, and blue video signals to the proper phosphor dots.
Since the electron beams for the R, G, and B phosphors originate from
slightly different positions (individual electron guns for each)
and thus arrive at slightly different angles, only the proper phosphors
are excited when the purity is properly adjusted and the necessary
magnetic field free region is maintained inside the CRT.  Note that
purity determines that the correct video signal excites the
proper color while convergence determines the geometric
alignment of the 3 colors.  Both are affected by magnetic fields.
Bad purity results in mottled or incorrect colors.  Bad convergence
results in color fringing at edges of characters or graphics.
<p>
The shadow mask consists of a thin steel or InVar (a ferrous alloy)
with a fine array of holes - one for each trio of phosphor
dots - positioned about 1/2 inch behind the surface of the phosphor
screen.  With most CRTs, the phosphors are arranged in triangular
formations called triads with each of the color dots at the apex
of the triangle.  With many TVs and some monitors, they are
arranged as vertical slots with the phosphors for the 3 colors
next to one another.
</p><p>
An aperture grille, used exclusively in Sony Trinitrons (and now
their clones as well), replaces the shadow mask with an array of finely
tensioned vertical wires.  Along with other characteristics of the
aperture grille approach, this permits a somewhat higher possible
brightness to be achieved and is more immune to other problems like
line induced moire and purity changes due to local heating causing
distortion of the shadow mask.
</p><p>
However, there are some disadvantages of the aperture grille design:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>weight - a heavy support structure must be provided for the tensioned
  wires (like a piano frame).
<p>
</p></li><li>price (proportional to weight).
<p>
</p></li><li>always a cylindrical screen (this may be considered an advantage
  depending on your preference.
<p>
</p></li><li>visible stabilizing wires which may be objectionable or unacceptable
  for certain applications.
</li></ul>
<p>
Apparently, there is no known way around the need to keep the fine
wires from vibrating or changing position due to mechanical shock
in high resolution tubes and thus all Trinitron monitors require
1, 2, or 3 stabilizing wires (depending on tube size) across the 
screen which can be see as very fine lines on bright images.  Some
people find these wires to be objectionable and for some critical
applications, they may be unacceptable (e.g., medical diagnosis).

</p><h3><a name="tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT</a></h3>

Degaussing may be required if there are color purity problems with the
display.  On rare occasions, there may be geometric distortion caused
by magnetic fields as well without color problems.  The CRT can get
magnetized:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>if the TV or monitor is moved or even just rotated.
<p>
</p></li><li>if there has been a lightning strike nearby.  A friend of mine
 had a lightning strike near his house which produced all of the
 effects of the EMP from a nuclear bomb.
<p>
</p></li><li>If a permanent magnet was brought near the screen (e.g., kid's
 magnet or megawatt stereo speakers).
<p>
</p></li><li>If some piece of electrical or electronic equipment with unshielded
 magnetic fields is in the vicinity of the TV or monitor.  
</li></ul>
<p>
Degaussing should be the first thing attempted whenever color purity problems
are detected.  As noted below, first try the internal degauss circuits of the
TV or monitor by power cycling a few times (on for a minute, off for at least
20 minutes, on for a minute, etc.) If this does not help or does not
completely cure the problem, then you can try manually degaussing.
</p><p>
Note: Some monitors have a degauss button, and monitors and TVs that are
microprocessor controlled may degauss automatically upon power-on (but may
require pulling the plug to do a hard reset) regardless of the amount of off
time.  However, repeated use of these 'features' in rapid succession may
result in overheating of the degauss coil or other components. The 20 minutes
off/1 minute on precedure is guaranteed to be safe.  (Some others may degauss
upon power-on as long as the previous degauss was not done within some
predetermined amount of time - they keep track with an internal timer.)
</p><p>
On portable TVs, degauss may only function when they are run on AC, not
the internal battery.  If color purity problems are present, plugging the
TV into an AC outlet may be needed to enable it to degauss itself.
</p><p>
Commercial CRT Degaussers are available from parts distributors
like MCM Electronics and consist of a hundred or so turns of magnet wire
in a 6-12 inch coil.  They include a line cord and momentary switch. You 
flip on the switch, and bring the coil to within several inches of the 
screen face. Then you slowly draw the center of the coil toward one edge 
of the screen and trace the perimeter of the screen face. Then return to 
the original position of the coil being flat against the center of the 
screen.  Next, slowly decrease the field to zero by backing straight up 
across the room as you hold the coil. When you are farther than 5 feet 
away you can release the line switch. 
</p><p>
The key word here is ** slow **.  Go too fast and you will freeze the
instantaneous intensity of the 50/60 Hz AC magnetic field variation
into the ferrous components of the CRT and may make the problem worse.
</p><p>
WARNING: Don't attempt to degauss inside or in the back of the set (near the
CRT neck.  This can demagnetize the relatively weak purity and convergence
magnets which may turn a simple repair into a feature length extravaganza!
</p><p>
It looks really cool to do this while the CRT is powered.  The kids will
love the color effects (but then lock your degaussing coil safely away so they
don't try it on every TV and monitor in the house!).
</p><p>
Bulk tape erasers, tape head degaussers, open frame transformers, and the
"butt-end" of a weller soldering gun can be used as CRT demagnetizers but
it just takes a little longer. (Be careful not to scratch the screen
face with anything sharp.  For the Weller, the tip needs to be in place
to get enough magnetic field.) It is imperative to have the CRT running when
using these whimpier approaches, so that you can see where there are 
still impurities. Never release the power switch until you're 4 or 5 
feet away from the screen or you'll have to start over.
</p><p>
I've never known of anything being damaged by excess manual degaussing
as long as you don't attempt to degauss *inside* or the back of the set - it
is possible to demagnetize geometry correction, purity, and static converence
magnets in the process!  However, I would recommend keeping really powerful
bulk tape erasers-turned-degaussers a couple of inches from the CRT.
</p><p>
Another alternative which has been known to work is to place another similar
size monitor face-to-face with the suspect monitor (take care not to bump or
scratch the screens!) and activate degauss function on the working
monitor.  While not ideal, this may be enough to also degauss the broken
one.
</p><p>
If an AC degaussing coil or substitute is unavailable, I have even done
degaussed with a permanent magnet but this is not recommended since it is more
likely to make the problem worse than better.  However, if the display
is unusable as is, then using a small magnet can do no harm. (Don't use
a 20 pound speaker or magnetron magnet as you may rip the shadow mask right
out of the CRT - well at least distort it beyond repair.  What I have in
mind is something about as powerful as a refrigerator magnet.)
</p><p>
Keep degaussing fields away from magnetic media.  It is a good idea to
avoid degaussing in a room with floppies or back-up tapes.  When removing
media from a room  remember to check desk drawers and manuals for stray
floppies, too. 
</p><p>
It is unlikely that you could actually affect magnetic media but better
safe than sorry.  Of the devices mentioned above, only a bulk eraser or
strong permanent magnet are likely to have any effect - and then only when
at extremely close range (direct contact with media container).
</p><p>
All color CRTs include a built-in degaussing coil wrapped around the 
perimeter of the CRT face. These are activated each time the CRT is 
powered up cold by a 3 terminal thermister device or other control
circuitry.  This is why it is often suggested that color purity problems
may go away "in a few days".  It isn't a matter of time; it's the number
of cold power ups that causes it.  It takes about 15 minutes of the power
being off for each cool down cycle. These built-in coils with thermal
control are never as effective as external coils.
</p><p>
Note that while the monochrome CRTs used in B/W and projection TVs and mono
monitors don't have anything inside to get magnetized, the chassis or other
cabinet parts of the equipment may still need degaussing.  While this isn't
likely from normal use or even after being moved or reoriented, a powerful
magnet (like that from a large speaker) could leave iron, steel, or other
ferrous parts with enough residual magnetism to cause a noticeable problem.
</p><p>

techniques, treatments for severe magnetization from lightning strikes,

<h2>TV Placement And Preventive Maintenance</h2>
<h3><a name="tvgtvpc">General TV placement considerations</a></h3>

Proper care of a TV does not require much.  Following the recommendations
below will assure long life and minimize repairs:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Subdued lighting is preferred for best viewing conditions  but I will not
 attempt to tell you how to arrange your room!
<p>
</p></li><li>Locate the TV away from extremes of hot and cold.  Avoid damp or dusty
 locations if possible.  (Right you say, keep dreaming!)
<p>
</p></li><li>Allow adequate ventilation - TVs use more power than any of your other
 A/V components.  Heat buildup takes its toll on electronic components.
 Leave at least 3 inches on top and sides for air circulation if the
 entertainment center does not have a wide open back panel.  Do not
 pile other components like VCRs on top of the TV if possible (see below).
<p>
</p></li><li>Do not put anything on top of the TV that might block the ventilation
 grill in the rear or top of the cover.  This is the major avenue for
 the convection needed to cool internal components.
<p>
</p></li><li>If possible, locate the VCR away from the TV.  Some VCRs are particularly
 sensitive to interference from the TV's circuitry and while this won't
 usually damage anything, it may make for less than optimal performance
 due to RF interference.  The reverse is sometimes true as well.
<p>
 In addition, modern VCRs are NOT built like the Brooklyn Bridge!  The
 weight of a TV or stereo components could affect the VCR mechanically,
 messing up tape path alignment or worse.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If possible, locate your computer monitor away from the TV.  Interaction
 of the electromagnetic fields of the deflection systems may result in
 one or both displays jiggling, wiggling, or vibrating.
<p>
</p></li><li>Locate loudspeakers and other sources of magnetic fields at least a couple
 of feet from the TV.  This will minimize the possibility of color purity
 or geometry problems.
<p>
</p></li><li>Make sure all input-output video and audio connections are tight and
 secure to minimize intermittent or noisy pictures and sound.  Use proper
 high quality cable only long enough to make connections conveniently.
<p>
</p></li><li>Finally, store video cassettes well away from all electronic equipment
 including and especially loudspeakers.  Heat and magnetic fields will
 rapidly turn your priceless video collection into so much trash.  The
 operation of the TV depends on magnetic fields for beam deflection. 
 Enough said.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvprevm">Preventive maintenance</a></h3>

Preventive maintenance for a TV is pretty simple - just keep the case clean
and free of obstructions.  Clean the screen with a soft cloth just dampened
with water and at most, mild detergent.  DO NOT use anything so wet that
liquid may seep inside of the set around the edge of the picture tube - you
could end up with a very expensive repair bill when the liquid shorts out
the main circuit board lurking just below.  If the set has a protective
flat glass faceplate, there is usually an easy way (on newer sets with this
type of protection) of removing it to get at the inner face of the CRT.  Clean
both the CRT and the protective glass with a soft damp cloth and dry
thoroughly.  If you have not cleaned the screen for quite a while, you will 
be amazed at the amount of black grime that collects due to the static
buildup from the high voltage CRT supply.
<p>
In really dusty situations, periodically vacuuming inside the case and the use
of contact cleaner for the controls might be a good idea but realistically,
you will not do this so don't worry about it.
</p><p>
For LCD TVs, LCD computer monitors, and laptop displays, the cleaning is
particularly critical.  The front surface of these facing the viewer is
generally not made of glass like those in CRT displays, but rather a plastic
layer or film.  Thus, any cleaning method that uses harsh chemicals
can permanently damage the screen, with or without an
anti-reflection coating.  Some glass cleaners, acetone (nail polish
remover), and other strong solvents can attack the plastic very quickly.
By the time you realize there is damage, it may be too late.     
And, of course, NEVER use anything even mildly abrasive.
</p><p>
A damp cloth with soap or detergent and water is
safe, as is generally a damp clost with a solution of 70 percent isopropyl
(rubbing) alcohol diluted in the ratio 1:1 with water.
</p><p>
However, it is essential to avoid allowing any liguid to seep inside along the
edges as this can short out the circuitry, especially the high voltage
back-light driver,which often located behind the trim at the bottom, and
possibly ruin the display entirely, or at least requiring a major repair.

</p><h3><a name="tvwautvc">Warning about using a TV as a computer or video game display</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I remember a while back (about 10 years) most home computers used to hook up
 to televisions. I seem to remember them having some effect on the TV though.
 I think they made the TV go blurry after a while. I was just wondering what
 these computers used to do to the televisions to mess them up like that.  I
 thought a TV signal was a TV signal."
</blockquote>
The problem was screen burn.  Since computers of that era were mostly text
and video games tended to use fixed patterns for scenery, patterns tended
to be burned into the phosphor such that they were noticeably darker and
less sensitive in those areas.  This was exacerbated by the tendency to
run those devices at very high brightness levels.
<p>
Modern computers and video games should not be nearly as much of a risk since
the displays are so much more varied and dynamic.  Nevertheless, setting the
brightness at a moderate level would be prudent.
</p><p>
However, projection sets with their much higher intensity CRTs may still be
susceptible to screen burn and the manufacturer will likely NOT cover the
cost of repairs.  There is probably a disclaimer to this effect in the
warranty.

<h2>TV Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3><a name="tvsaf">SAFETY</a></h3>

TVs and computer or video monitors are among the more dangerous of consumer
electronic equipment when it comes to servicing.  (Microwave ovens are
probably the most hazardous due to high voltage at high power.)
<p>
There are two areas which have particularly nasty electrical dangers: the
non-isolated line power supply and the CRT high voltage.
</p><p>
Major parts of nearly all modern TVs and many computer monitors are directly
connected to the AC line - there is no power transformer to provide the
essential barrier for safety and to minimize the risk of equipment damage.
In the majority of designs, the live parts of the TV or monitor are limited
to the AC input and line filter, degauss circuit, bridge rectifier and main
filter capacitor(s), low voltage (B+) regulator (if any), horizontal output
transistor and primary side of the flyback (LOPT) transformer, and parts
of the startup circuit and standby power supply.  The flyback generates most
of the other voltages used in the unit and provides an isolation barrier so
that the signal circuits are not line connected and safer.
</p><p>
Since a bridge rectifier is generally used in the power supply, both
directions of the polarized plug result in dangerous conditions and an
isolation transformer really should be used - to protect you, your test
equipment, and the TV, from serious damage.  Some TVs do not have any
isolation barrier whatsoever - the entire chassis is live.  These are
particularly nasty.
</p><p>
The high voltage to the CRT, while 200 times greater than the line input,
is not nearly as dangerous for several reasons.  First, it is present in a
very limited area of the TV or monitor - from the output of the flyback
to the CRT anode via the fat HV wire and suction cup connector.  If you
don't need to remove the mainboard or replace the flyback or CRT, then
leave it alone and it should not bite.  Furthermore, while the shock from
the HV can be quite painful due to the capacitance of the CRT envelope, it
is not nearly as likely to be lethal since the current available from the
line connected power supply is much greater.

</p><h3><a name="tvsafg">Safety guidelines</a></h3>

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.
<p>
Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart.  Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.
</p><p>
The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions.  Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical.  Just be sure that it is also safe!
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's presence
 may be essential.
<p>
</p></li><li>Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
 line-connected or high voltage system.
<p>
</p></li><li>Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.
<p>
</p></li><li>Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
 circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.
<p>
</p></li><li>Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may accidentally
 contact.
<p>
</p></li><li>Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
 as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect to the
 earth ground of the AC line.  Microwave ovens use the chassis as ground
 return for the high voltage.  In addition, do not assume that the chassis
 is a suitable ground for your test equipment!
<p>
</p></li><li>If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put insulating
 material between the boards and anything they may short to.  Hold them in
 place with string or electrical tape.  Prop them up with insulation sticks -
 plastic or wood.
<p>
</p></li><li>If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power off,
 discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W or greater
 resistor of 100 to 500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200 V capacitor,
 use a 20K to 100K ohm resistor).  Monitor while discharging and verify that
 there is no residual charge with a suitable voltmeter.  In a TV or monitor,
 if you are removing the high voltage connection to the CRT (to replace the
 flyback transformer for example) first discharge the CRT contact (under the
 suction cup at the end of the fat HV wire).  Use a 1M to 10M ohm 5 W or
 greater wattage (for its voltage holdoff capability, not power dissipation)
 resistor on the end of an insulating stick or the probe of a high voltage
 meter.  Discharge to the metal frame which is connected to the outside of
 the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
 CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
 An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
 direction.  There are several tons of force attempting to crush the typical
 CRT.  While implosion is not really likely even with modest abuse, why take
 chances?  However, the CRT neck is relatively thin and fragile and breaking
 it would be very embarrassing and costly.  Always wear eye protection when
 working around the back side of a CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
 unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
 locations or difficult to access locations.
<p>
</p></li><li>If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
 of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
 could cause damage to various components.  Clip the reference end of the
 meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
 probe with one hand.
<p>
</p></li><li>Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
 unplugged.  For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
 of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.
<p>
</p></li><li>Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
 connected circuits.  A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer!
 The use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
 good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
 connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven, for
 example.  (Note however, that, a GFCI may nuisanse trip at power-on or at
 other random times due to leakage paths (like your scope probe ground) or
 the highly capacitive or inductive input characteristics of line powered
 equipment.)  A fuse or circuit breaker is too slow and insensitive to provide
 any protection for you or in many cases, your equipment.  However, these
 devices may save your scope probe ground wire should you accidentally connect
 it to a live chassis.
<p>
</p></li><li>Don't attempt repair work when you are tired.  Not only will you be more
 careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
 not be operating at full capacity.
<p>
</p></li><li>Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
 Don't take shortcuts!
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvwarndcn">Warning about disconnecting CRT neck board</a></h3>

Some manufacturers warn against powering a TV or monitor CRT without the
CRT neck board connected.  Apparently, without something - anything -
to drain the charge resulting from the current flow due to residual gas ions
inside the CRT, the shortest path may be through the glass neck of the tube
to the yoke or from the pins outside the CRT to whatever is nearby.   There
aren't many ions in a modern CRT but I suppose a few here, a few there, and
eventually they add up to enough to cause a major disaster at least on some
CRTs.
<p>
This is probably not a problem on small CRTs but for large ones with high
high voltages and high deflection angles where the glass of the neck is
very thin to allow for maximum deflection sensitivity, the potential does
exist for arcing through the glass to the yoke to occur, destroying the CRT.
</p><p>
There is really no way to know which models will self destruct but it
should be possible to avoid such a disaster by providing a temporary return
path to the DAG ground of the CRT (NOT SIGNAL GROUND!!) via the focus or G2
pins preferably through a high value high voltage rated resistor just in
case one of these is shorted.
</p><p>
This probably applies mostly to large direct-view TVs since they use high
deflection angle CRTs but it won't hurt to take appropriate precautions with
video and computer monitors as well.

</p><h3><a name="tvttips">Troubleshooting tips</a></h3>

Many problems have simple solutions.  Don't immediately assume that
your problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted
failures.  For a TV, it may just be a bad connection or blown fuse.  Remember
that the problems with the most catastrophic impact on operation like a dead
TV usually have the simplest solutions.  The kind of problems we would
like to avoid at all costs are the ones that are intermittent
or difficult to reproduce: the occasional interference or a TV that
refuses to play 'StarTrek Voyager'.
<p>
If you get stuck, sleep on it.  Sometimes, just letting the problem
bounce around in your head will lead to a different more successful
approach or solution.  Don't work when you are really tired - it is both
dangerous (especially with respect to TVs) and mostly non-productive
(or possibly destructive).
</p><p>
Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams.
You will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit.
Most connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange
of cables, but not always.  Apparently identical screws may be of differing
lengths or have slightly different thread types.  Little parts may fit in
more than one place or orientation.  Etc.  Etc.
</p><p>
Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly.  This
is particularly true if you have repairs on multiple pieces of equipment
under way simultaneously.
</p><p>
Select a work area which is wide open, well lighted, and where dropped
parts can be located - not on a deep pile shag rug.  The best location will
also be relatively dust free and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting
to eat or sleep or think without having to pile everything into a cardboard
box for storage.
</p><p>
Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge.  Some components
(like ICs) in a TV are vulnerable to ESD.  There is no need to go overboard
but taking reasonable precautions such as getting into the habit of touching
a **safe** ground point first.
</p><p>
WARNING: even with an isolation transformer, a live chassis should **not** be
considered a safe ground point.  When the set is unplugged, the tuner shield
or other signal ground points should be safe and effective.
</p><p>
A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble
a TV and perform most adjustments.  These do not need to be really
expensive but poor quality tools are worse than useless and can cause
damage.  Needed tools include a selection of Philips and straight blade
screwdrivers, socket drivers, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers,
and dental picks.  For adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade) screwdriver
with a non-metallic tip is desirable both to prevent the presence of
metal from altering the electrical properties of the circuit and to
minimize the possibility of shorting something from accidental contact
with the circuitry.  A set of plastic alignment tools will be useful for
making adjustments to coils and RF transformers.
</p><p>
A low power (e.g., 25 W) fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder
will be needed if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires (on purpose
or by accident) or replace soldered components.  A higher power iron or small
soldering gun will be needed for dealing with larger components.
</p><p>
CAUTION: You can easily turn a simple repair (e.g., bad solder connections)
into an expensive mess if you use inappropriate soldering equipment and/or
lack the soldering skills to go along with it.  If in doubt, find someone else
to do the soldering or at least practice, practice, practice, soldering and
desoldering on a junk circuit board first!  See the document:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tshoot.htm">Troubleshooting and Repair of Consumer Electronic
Equipment</a> for additional info on soldering and rework techniques.
</p><p>
For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature.  Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat
gun can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.
</p><p>
For info on useful chemicals, adhesives, and lubricants, see "Repair Briefs,
an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

</p><h3><a name="tvtsteq">Test equipment</a></h3>

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking.  Your powers of observation (and a little experience) will make
a good start.   Your built in senses and that stuff between
your ears represents the most important test equipment you have.
<p>
However, some test equipment will be needed:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Multimeter (DMM or VOM) - This is essential for checking of power supply
 voltages and voltages on the pins of ICs or other components - service
 literature like the Sams' Photofacts described elsewhere in this document
 include voltage measurements at nearly every circuit tie point for properly
 functioning equipment.  The multimeter will also be used to check 
 components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors for correct value
 and for shorts or opens.  You do not need a fancy instrument.  A basic 
 DMM - as long as it is reliable - will suffice for most troubleshooting.
 If you want one that will last for many years, go with a Fluke.  However,
 even the mid range DMMs from Radio Shack have proven to be reliable and
 of acceptable accuracy.  For some kinds of measurements - to deduce trends
 for example - an analog VOM is preferred (though some DMMs have a bar graph
 scale which almost as good).
<p>
</p></li><li>Oscilloscope - While many problems can be dealt with using just a
 multimeter, a 'scope will be essential as you get more into advanced
 troubleshooting.  Basic requirements are: dual trace, 10-20 MHz minimum
 vertical bandwidth, delayed sweep desirable but not essential.  A good set
 of proper 10X/1X probes.  Higher vertical bandwidth is desirable but most
 consumer electronics work can be done with a 10 MHz scope.  A storage scope
 or digital scope might be desirable for certain tasks but is by no means
 essential for basic troubleshooting.
<p>
 I would recommend a good used Tektronix (Tek) or Hewlett Packard (HP)
 scope over a new scope of almost any other brand.  You will usually get
 more scope for your money and these things last almost forever.  Until
 recently, my 'good' scope was the militarized version (AN/USM-281A) of
 the HP180 lab scope.  It has a dual channel 50 MHz vertical plugin and
 a delayed sweep horizontal plugin.  I have seen these going for under
 $300 from surplus outfits.  For a little more money, you can get a
 Tek 465 or 465B (newer version but similar specifications) 100 Mhz
 scope ($200 to $600, sometimes cheaper on eBay or elsewhere but there
 is more risk than buying from a reputable dealer).  I have now acquired
 a Tek 465B and that's what I use mostly these days.  The HP-180 is still
 fine but I couldn't pass up a really good deal. :)  The Tek 465/B or other
 similar model will suffice for all but the most demanding (read: RF or
 high speed digital) repairs.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>A video signal source - both RF and baseband (RCA jacks).  Unless you
 are troubleshooting tuner or video/audio input problems, either one
 will suffice.  RF sources include a pair of rabbit ears or an outdoor
 antenna, a cable connection, or a VCR with a working RF modulator.
 This will be more convenient than an antenna connection and will permit
 you to control the program material.  In fact, making some test tapes
 using a camcorder or video camera to record static test patterns will
 allow you full control of what is being displayed and for how long.
<p>
</p></li><li>Color bar/dot/crosshatch signal generator.  This is a useful piece
 of equipment if you are doing a lot of TV or monitor repair and need
 to perform CRT convergence and chroma adjustments.  However, there
 are alternatives that are almost as good: a VHS recording of these
 test patterns will work for TVs.  A PC programmed to output a suitable
 set of test patterns will be fine for monitors (and TVs if you can set
 up the video card to produce an NTSC/PAL signal.  This can be put
 through a VCR to generate the RF (Channel 3/4) input to your TV if
 it does not have direct video inputs (RCA jacks).
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvihw">Incredibly Handy widgets</a></h3>

These are the little gadgets and homemade testers that are useful for many
repair situations.  Here are just a few of the most basic:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Series light bulb for current limiting during the testing of TVs,
 monitors, switching power supplies, audio power amplifiers, etc. I built
 a dual outlet box with the outlets wired in series so that a lamp
 can be plugged into one outlet and the device under test into the other.
 For added versatility, add a regular outlet and 'kill' switch using a
 quad box instead.  The use of a series load will prevent your expensive
 replacement part like a horizontal output transistor from blowing if
 there is still some fault in the circuit you have failed to locate.
<p>
</p></li><li>A Variac.  It doesn't need to be large - a 2 A Variac mounted with
 a switch, outlet and fuse will suffice for most tasks.  However,
 a 5 amp or larger Variac is desirable.  If you will be troubleshooting
 220 VAC equipment in the US, there are Variacs that will output 0-240 VAC
 from a 115 VAC line (just make sure you don't forget that this can easily
 fry your 115 VAC equipment.)  By varying the line voltage, not only can
 you bring up a newly repaired TV gradually to make sure there are no
 problems but you can also evaluate behavior at low and high line voltage.
 This can greatly aid in troubleshooting power supply problems.  Warning: a
 Variac is not an isolation transformer and does not help with respect
 to safety.  You need an isolation transformer as well.
<p>
</p></li><li>Isolation transformer.  This is very important for safely working on
 live chassis equipment.  Since all modern TVs use a line connected power
 supply, it is essential.  You can build one from a pair of similar
 power transformers back-to-back (with their highest rated secondaries
 connected together.  I built mine from a couple of similar old
 tube type TV power transformers mounted on a board with an outlet box
 including a fuse.  Their high voltage windings were connected together.
 The unused low voltage windings can be put in series with the primary
 or output windings to adjust voltage.  Alternatively, commercial line
 isolation transformers suitable for TV troubleshooting are available
 for less than $100 - well worth every penny.
<p>
</p></li><li>Variable isolation transformer.  You don't need to buy a fancy combination
 unit.  A Variac can be followed by a normal isolation transformer.  (The
 opposite order also works.  There may be some subtle differences in
 load capacity.).
</li></ul>
<p>
CAUTION: Keep any large transformer of this type well away from your monitor
or TV.  The magnetic field it produces may cause the picture to wiggle or the
colors to become messed up - and you to think there is an additional problem!
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Degaussing coil.  Make or buy.  The internal degaussing coil salvaged
 from a defunct TV doubled over to half it original diameter to increase
 its strength in series with a 200 W light bulb for current limiting will
 work just fine.  Or, buy one from a place like MCM Electronics - about
 $15 for one suitable for all but the largest TVs.   Also, see the section:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT</a>.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvsafdis">Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video monitors</a></h3>

It is essential - for your safety and to prevent damage to the device under
test as well as your test equipment - that large or high voltage capacitors
be fully discharged before measurements are made, soldering is attempted,
or the circuitry is touched in any way.  Some of the large filter capacitors
commonly found in line operated equipment store a potentially lethal charge.
<p>
This doesn't mean that every one of the 250 capacitors in your TV need to be
discharged every time you power off and want to make a measurement.  However,
the large main filter capacitors and other capacitors in the power supplies
should be checked and discharged if any significant voltage is found after
powering off (or before any testing - the CRT capacitance in a TV or video
monitor, for example, can retain a dangerous or at least painful charge for
days or longer!)
</p><p>
The technique I recommend is to use a high wattage resistor of about
5 to 50 ohms/V of the working voltage of the capacitor.  This isn't critical -
a bit more or less will be fine but will affect the time it takes to fully
discharge the capacitor.  The use of a current limiting resistor will
prevent the arc-welding associated with screwdriver discharge but will
have a short enough time constant so that the capacitor will drop to
a low voltage in at most a few seconds (dependent of course on the
RC time constant and its original voltage).
</p><p>
Then check with a voltmeter to be double sure.  Better yet, monitor
while discharging (not needed for the CRT - discharge is nearly
instantaneous even with multi-M ohm resistor).
</p><p>
Obviously, make sure that you are well insulated!
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>For the main capacitors in a TV or monitor power supply which might be
 400 uF at 200 V, this would mean a 5K, 10W resistor.  RC = 2 seconds.
 5RC = 10 seconds.  A lower wattage resistor can be used since the total
 energy in not that great.   If you want to be more high tech, you can
 build the capacitor discharge circuit outlined in the companion
 document: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/captest.htm">Capacitor Testing, Safe Discharging, and
 Other Related Information</a>.   This provides a visible indication of
 remaining charge and polarity.
<p>
</p></li><li>For the CRT, use a several M ohm resistor good for 30 kV or more (or a
 string of lower value resistors to obtain this voltage rating).  A 1/4 watt
 job will just arc over!  Discharge to the chassis ground connected to the
 outside of the CRT - NOT SIGNAL GROUND ON THE MAIN BOARD as you may damage
 sensitive circuitry.  The time constant is very short - a ms or so.
 However, repeat a few times to be sure, then use a shorting clip as these
 capacitors have a way of recovering a painful charge if left alone - there
 have been too many stories of painful experiences from charge developing for
 whatever reasons ready to bite when the HV lead is reconnected.
<p>
 Note that if you are touching the little board on the neck of the CRT, you
 may want to discharge the HV even if you are not disconnecting the fat red
 wire - the focus and screen (G2) voltages on that board are derived from the
 CRT HV.
</p><p>
 WARNING: Most common resistors - even 5 W jobs - are rated for only a few
 hundred volts and are not suitable for the 25 kV or more found in modern
 TVs and monitors.  Alternatives to a long string of regular resistors are
 a high voltage probe or a known good focus/screen divider network.  However,
 note that the discharge time constant with these may be a few seconds.  Also
 see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvaiodc">Additional information on discharging
 CRTs</a>.
</p><p>
 If you are not going to be removing the CRT anode connection, replacing
 the flyback, or going near the components on the little board on the neck
 of the CRT, I would just stay away from the fat red wire and what it is
 connected to including the focus and screen wires.  Repeatedly shoving
 a screwdriver under the anode cap risks scratching the CRT envelope which
 is something you really do not want to do.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
Again, always double check with a reliable voltmeter!
</p><p>
Reasons to use a resistor and not a screwdriver to discharge capacitors:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>It will not destroy screwdrivers and capacitor terminals.
<p>
</p></li><li>It will not damage the capacitor (due to the current pulse).
<p>
</p></li><li>It will reduce your spouse's stress level in not having to hear those
  scary snaps and crackles.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvaiodc">Additional information on discharging CRTs</a></h3>

You may hear that it is only safe to discharge from the Ultor to the Dag.
So, what the @#$% are they talking about? :-).
<p>
(From: Asimov (mike.ross@juxta.mnet.pubnix.ten).)
</p><p>
'Dag' is short for Aquadag. It is a type of paint made of a graphite pigment
which is conductive. It is painted onto the inside and outside of picture
tubes to form the 2 plates of a high voltage filter capacitor using the glass
in between as dielectric. This capacitor is between .005uF and .01uF in
value. This seems like very little capacity but it can store a substantial
charge with 25,000 volts applied.
</p><p>
The outside "Dag" is always connected to the circuit chassis ground via a
series of springs, clips, and wires around the picture tube. The high voltage
or "Ultor" terminal must be discharged to chassis ground before working on the
circuit especially with older TV's which didn't use a voltage divider to
derive the focus potential or newer TV's with a defective open divider.
</p><p>
CAUTION: The Dag coating/springs/clips/etc. may not be the same as signal
ground on the mainboard.  Discharging to that instead could result in all
sorts of expensive blown components.  Discharging between the CRT anode cap
and Dag should be low risk though it is best to use a HV probe or properly
rated high value resistor.
</p><p>
For more details, see the document: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/crtfaq.htm">TV and Monitor CRT
(Picture Tube) Information</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvrchvc">Removing the CRT HV connector</a></h3>

WARNING: Make sure the CRT has been discharged FIRST!
<p>
The rubber part is usually not glued down so it can be lifted rather easily.
However, there may be some silicone type grease between the rubber boot (that
looks like a suction cup) and the CRT glass to seal out dust.
</p><p>
A metal clip with a spring keeping it spread out attaches inside the button.
</p><p>
While there are a variety of types of clips actually used, pushing the
connector to one side and/or squeezing it in the appropriate direction (peel
up one side of the rubber to inspect) while gently lifting up should free it.
Probably :-).
</p><p>
The clip (when removed) and CRT button look sort of like this:
</p><p>

</p><h3><a name="tvsttlpt">Safe troubleshooting techniques for line powered TVs</a></h3>

TVs are particularly dangerous with respect to troubleshooting due to the fact
that a substantial portion of their circuitry - sometimes all of it - is
directly line connected.  Even if your are working in a totally unrelated
area like the sound circuits, awareness of the general design and location
of the line-connected circuits can prove to be a life saver.
<p>
These designs may take several forms:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><b>Separate switchmode power supply (SMPS):</b> In this case, only the
 primary side of the power supply is line connected.  The remainder of the
 TV is usually isolated from the line by the high frequency transformer and
 feedback device (transformer or optoisolator) of the switchmode power
 supply.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>On-board SMPS:</b> A portion of the circuitry on the mainboard is directly
 line-connected.  In the best case, this is restricted to the area around
 the power cord connections and well marked on both top and bottom but don't
 count on it.  Again, the rest of the TV may be isolated but avoiding
 hazardous areas is more difficult especially in cramped quarters.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Flyback derived power supply:</b> A non-isolated linear (usually) power supply
 provides B+ to the horizontal deflection (and startup circuit).  All other
 system power is derived from secondary windings on the flyback transformer.
 Similar comments to (2) above apply.
</li></ol>
<p>
(1) to (3) may be found in TVs with A/V inputs and outputs.
</p><p>
</p><ol start="4">
<li><b>Full hot chassis:</b> A bridge rectifier/filter capacitor/linear regulator
 provides some voltages including B+.  The flyback secondaries provide the
 remaining voltages.  All share a common return which is at the intersection
 of two of the diodes of the bridge rectifier.  There is no isolation.
<p>
 This type of design will usually not be found in a TV where there are
 external connections (other than the RF antenna/cable connector which can
 be capacitively isolated and you may actually get an AC reading or even
 sparks between the RF shield and an earth ground due to this capacitance.)
</p><p>
 WARNING: Never attempt to add A/V inputs or outputs to such a TV as the
 signals and shields will be electrically live.
</p><p>
 However, some TVs with A/V inputs/outputs actually had a live chassis and
 used an isolated means of coupling the signals from/to the external jacks:
</p><p>
 (From: Bill Coffel (bc@datamix.com).)
</p><p>
 The late 70's and early 80's Sony CVM 1250/1750/2150 (12"/17"/21") monitors
 (TV) have a HOT chassis.  In fact they are kV-1201/1701/2101 TV sets in
 larger cabinet With a 3 prong plug!!!!  The inputs and outputs are isolated
 via opto couplers and transformers on an additional circuit board (about 6"
 by 8" and powered by a small transformer) the connector panel is the only
 part grounded via the third prong.
</p><p>
 If someone thinks its not a live chassis they are in for quite a shock.
</p></li></ol>
<p>
Always use an isolation transformer, whatever kind of design is used in the
equipment you are troubleshooting.  There are very few situations in which
an isolation transformer will hurt.  If you use it automatically, you will
never have a chance to screw up.
</p><p>
Identify the appropriate ground point (return) for your multimeter or scope.
These should be marked in the Sams' Photofact or service manual.  There may
be several such returns such as: non-isolated, signal, and CRT.  Selecting
the wrong one - even momentarily connecting to it - can ruin your whole day.
</p><p>
If you are not using an isolation transformer (a no-no), connecting your
scope to the wrong ground point can result in (1) blown fuses and/or blown
parts, and a very dangerous situation and (2) readings that don't make sense
generally with distorted power line frequency signals of high amplitude.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Use the non-isolated ground (A) (with your isolation transformer on the TV
 *only* for measurements of voltage on the line-connected power supply.
<p>
</p></li><li>Use the signal ground (B) for all measurements of tuner, IF, video, and
 sound circuits.
<p>
Whenever you get a reading or waveform that is grossly wrong, confirm that
you are using the proper ground point!  Note that failures of fusable
resistors in the *return* of the HOT or power supply chopper or elsewhere
can also result in points that should be near ground floating at unexpected
voltage levels.
</p><p>
The general arrangement of components for a typical TV using a linear B+
supply with isolated auxiliary supplies for the signal circuits is shown
below including the (linear) line-connected power supply, horizontal
deflection output (drive, horizontal output transistor, flyback), and
a typical Aux power supply output.

<h3><a name="tvtslbt">The series light bulb trick</a></h3>

When powering up a TV (or any other modern electronic devices with expensive
power semiconductors) that has had work done on any power circuits, it is
desirable to minimize the chance of blowing your newly installed parts should
there still be a fault.  There are two ways of doing this: use of a Variac to
bring up the AC line voltage gradually and the use of a series load to limit
current to power semiconductors.
<p>
Actually using a series load - a light bulb is just a readily available cheap
load - is better than a Variac (well both might be better still) since it will
limit current to (hopefully) non-destructive levels.
</p><p>
What you want to do is limit current to the critical parts - usually the
horizontal output transistor (HOT).  Most of the time you will get away with
putting it in series with the AC line.  However, sometimes, putting a light
bulb directly in the B+ circuit will be needed to provide adequate protection.
In that location, it will limit the current to the HOT from the main filter
capacitors of line connected power supplies.  This may also be required with
some switchmode power supplies as they can still supply bursts of full (or
excessive) current even if there is a light bulb in series with the AC line.
</p><p>
Actually, an actual power resistor is probably better as its resistance is
constant as opposed to a light bulb which will vary by 1:10 from cold to hot.
The light bulb, however, provides a nice visual indication of the current
drawn by the circuit under test.  For example:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Full brightness: short circuit or extremely heavy load - a fault probably
 is still present.
<p>
</p></li><li>Initially bright but then settles at reduced brightness: filter capacitors
 charge, then lower current to rest of circuit.  This is what is expected
 when the equipment is operating normally.  There could still be a problem
 with the power circuits but it will probably not result in an immediate
 catastrophic failure.
<p>
</p></li><li>Pulsating: power supply is trying to come up but shutting down due to
 overcurrent or overvoltage condition.  This could be due to a continuing
 fault or the light bulb may be too small for the equipment.
</li></ul>
<p>
Note: for a TV or monitor, it may be necessary (and desirable) to unplug the
degauss coil as this represents a heavy initial load which may prevent the unit
from starting up with the light bulb in the circuit.
</p><p>
The following are suggested starting wattages:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>40 W bulb for VCR or laptop computer switching power supplies.
</li><li>100 W bulb for small (i.e., B/W or 13 inch color) TVs.
</li><li>150 to 200 W bulb for large color or projection TVs.
</li></ul>
<p>
A 50/100/150 W (or similar) 3-way bulb in an appropriate socket comes in
handy for this but mark the switch so that you know which setting is which!
</p><p>
Depending on the power rating of the equipment, these wattages may need to be
increased.  However, start low.  If the bulb lights at full brightness, you
know there is still a major fault.  If it flickers or the TV (or other device)
does not quite come fully up, then it should be safe to go to a larger bulb.
Resist the temptation to immediately remove the series light bulb totally from
the circuit at this point - I have been screwed by doing this.  Try a
larger one first.  The behavior should improve.  If it does not, there
is still a fault present.
</p><p>
Note that some TVs and monitors simply will not power up at all with any kind
of series load - at least not with one small enough (in terms of wattage) to
provide any real protection.  The microcontroller apparently senses the drop
in voltage and shuts the unit down or continuously cycles power.  Fortunately,
these seem to be the exceptions.

</p><h3><a name="tvgiatv">Getting inside a TV</a></h3>

You will void the warranty - at least in principle.  There are usually no
warranty seals on a TV so unless you cause visible damage or mangle the
screws, it is unlikely that this would be detected.  You need to decide.
A TV still under warranty should probably be returned for warranty
service for any covered problems except those with the most obvious
and easy solutions.  Another advantage of using warranty service is that
should your problem actually be covered by a design change, this will be
performed free of charge.  And, you cannot generally fix a problem which
is due to poor design!
<p>
Getting into a TV is usually quite simple requiring the removal of anywhere
from 4 to 16 Philips or 1/4" hex head screws - most around the rear edge of the
cabinet or underneath, a couple perhaps in the middle.  Disconnect the antenna
and/or antenna or cable wiring first as it may stay with catch on the rear
cover you are detaching.  Reconnect whatever is needed for testing after the
cover is removed.
</p><p>
As you pull the cover straight back (usually) and off, make sure that no
other wires are still attached.  Often, the main circuit board rests on
the bottom of the cover in some slots.  Go slow as this circuit board may
try to come along with the back.  Once the back is off, you may need to prop
the circuit board up with a block of wood to prevent stress damage and contact
with the work surface.
</p><p>
Most TVs can still be positioned stably on any of three sides (left, right,
bottom) even without the rear cover.  However, some require the cover for
mechanical strength or to not easily fall over.  Be careful- larger TVs,
in particular, are quite heavy and bulky.  Get someone to help and take
precautions if yours is one of the unstable variety.  If need be, the set
can usually safely be positioned on the CRT face if it is supported by
foam or a folded blanket.
</p><p>
Reassemble in reverse order.  Getting the circuit board to slide smoothly
into its slots may take a couple of attempts but otherwise there should
be no surprises.

</p><h3><a name="tvscbpait">Specific considerations before poking around inside a TV or monitor</a></h3>

Both electrical and mechanical dangers lurk:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Main filter capacitor(s).  This is the most dangerous (not the HV as you
 would expect).  Fortunately, these capacitors will normally discharge in
 a few minutes or less especially if the unit is basically working as the
 load will normally discharge the capacitors nearly fully as power is
 turned off.  With TVs, the main filter capacitor is nearly always on the
 mainboard.  Monitors are more likely to have a separate power supply
 module.
<p>
 However, you should check across this capacitor - usually only one and by
 far the largest in the set - with a voltmeter and discharge as suggested
 in the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsafdis">Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs
 and video monitors</a> if it holds more than a few volts (or wait longer)
 before touching anything.
</p><p>
 Some of these are as large as 1,000 uF charged to 160 V - about 13 w-s or
 a similar amount of energy as that stored in an electronic flash.  This is
 enough to be potentially lethal under the wrong circumstances.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>High Voltage capacitor formed by the envelope of the CRT.  It is connected
 to the flyback transformer by the fat (usually red) wire at the suction cup
 (well, it looks like one anyhow) attached to the CRT.  This capacitor can
 hold a charge for quite a while - weeks in the case of an old tube type TV!
<p>
 If you want to be doubly sure, discharge this also.  However, unless you
 are going to be removing the HV connector/flyback, it should not bother you.
</p><p>
 The energy stored is about 1 w-s but if you touch it or come near to an
 exposed terminal, due to the high voltage, you will likely be handed *all*
 the energy and you *will* feel it.  The danger is probably more in the
 collateral damage when you jump ripping flesh and smashing your head against
 the ceiling.
</p><p>
 Some people calibrate their jump based on voltage - about 1 inch/V. :-).
</p><p>
 There will be some HV on the back of the circuit board on the neck of the
 CRT but although you might receive a tingle but accidentally touching the
 focus or screen (G2) pins, it is not likely to be dangerous.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>CRT implosion risk.  Don't hammer on it.  However, it is more likely that
 you will break the neck off the tube since the neck is relatively weak.  This
 will ruin your whole day and the TV or monitor but will likely not result in
 flying glass everywhere.  Just, don't go out of your way to find out.
<p>
</p></li><li>Sharp sheet metal and so forth.  This is not in itself dangerous but
 a reflex reaction can send your flesh into it with nasty consequences.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvdusttv">Dusting out the inside of a TV</a></h3>

The first thing you will notice when you remove the cover is how super
dusty everything is.  Complements to the maid.  You never dreamed there
was that much dust, dirt, and grime, in the entire house!
<p>
Use a soft brush (like a new paintbrush) and a vacuum cleaner to carefully
remove the built up dust.  Blowing off the dust will likely not hurt the TV
unless it gets redeposited inside various controls or switches but will
be bad for your lungs - and will spread it all over the room.  Don't turn
anything - many critical adjustments masquerade as screws that just beg to
be tightened.  Resist the impulse for being neat and tidy until you know
exactly what you are doing.  Be especially careful around the components on
the neck of the CRT - picture tube - as some of these are easily shifted
in position and control the most dreaded of adjustments - for color purity
and convergence.  In particular, there will be a series of adjustable ring
magnets.  It is a good idea to mark their position in any case with
some white paint, 'white out', or a Magic Marker so that if they do get
moved - or you move them deliberately, you will know where you started.

</p><h3><a name="tvtatwtmd">Troubleshooting a TV with the mainboard disconnected</a></h3>

There are times when it is desirable to remove the chassis or mainboard and
work on it in a convenient location without having to worry about the
equipment which will simulate the critical functions but this is rarely
an option for the doit-yourselfer.
<p>
My approach is usually to do as much work as possible without removing the
main board and not attempt to power it up when disconnected since there are
too many unknowns.  Professionals will plug the chassis into a piece of
equipment which will simulate the critical functions.
</p><p>
Note that if you have a failure of the power supply - blown fuse, startup,
etc., then it should be fine to disconnect the CRT since these problems
are usually totally unrelated.  Tests should be valid.
</p><p>
However, if you really want to do live testing with the main board removed,
here are some considerations.  There are usually several connections to the
CRT and cabinet:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Deflection yoke - since the horizontal coils are part of the horizontal
 flyback circuit, there could be problems running without a yoke.  This
 could be anything from it appearing totally dead to an overheating or
 blown horizontal output transistor.  There may be no problems.  Vertical
 and any convergence coils may or may not be problems as well.
<p>
</p></li><li>CRT video Driver board - pulling this should not usually affect anything
 except possibly video output and bias voltages.
<p>
</p></li><li>CRT 2nd anode - without the CRT, there will be no capacitor to filter
 the high voltage and you would certaily want to insulate the HV connector
 **real** well.  I do not know whether there are cases where damage to
 flyback could result from running in thie manner, however.
<p>
</p></li><li>Front panel controls - disconnecting these may result in inability to
 even turn the set on, erratic operation, and other unexpected behavior.
<p>
</p></li><li>Degauss - you just won't have this function when disconnected.  But who
 cares - you are not going to be looking at the screen anyhow.
<p>
</p></li><li>Remote sensor - no remote control but I doubt that the floating
 signals will cause problems.
<p>
</p></li><li>Speakers - there will be no audio but this should not cause damage.
</li></ul>
<p>
If you do disconnect everything, make sure to label any connectors whose
location or orientation may be ambiguous.  Most of the time, these will
only fit one way but not always.

<h2>TV Adjustments</h2>

These include both controls accessible to the user (and often not understood)
as well as internal adjustments that may need to be touched up due to the
aging of components or following a repair.

<h3><a name="tvupadj">User picture adjustment</a></h3>

For general viewing, subdued lighting but not total darkness is probably
best.  However, for most dramatic impact, a darkened environment may be
preferred.  Make the following adjustments under the expected viewing
conditions.
<p>
Tune to a strong channel or play a good quality tape.
</p><p>
Turn the brightness, contrast, and color controls all the way down.  Center
the tint control (NTSC, may not be present on PAL sets).
</p><p>
Increase the brightness until a raster is just visible in the darkest
(shadow) areas of the picture and then back off until it **just** disappears.
</p><p>
Increase the contrast until the desired intensity of highlights is obtained.
</p><p>
Since brightness and contrast are not always independent, go back and forth
until you get the best picture.
</p><p>
Initially adjust the color control for pastel shades rather than highly
saturated color.  Set the tint control for best flesh tones.  Then,
increase the color control to obtain the desired degree of color saturation.

</p><h3><a name="tvintadjs">Internal adjustments</a></h3>

All of the service adjustments are accomplished either using controls inside
the set (though some may be accessible by holes in the rear of the cabinet).
These are usually pots on the mainboard and CRT neck boards, or in newer
TVs, mostly via a service menu accessed from the remote or by using a
manufacturer specific computer interface.
<p>
A Web site with some information on the general objectives of video and
color setup procedures for both direct view and projection TVs is
<a href="http://www.tru-line.com/">Tru-line Video Technologies</a>.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where actual pots are present, they may be labeled on the circuit boards or
 identified by a sticker on the TV's cover.  Otherwise, the service manual or
 Sams' for the set will be required unless their function of the relevant pot
 is obvious.
<p>
</p></li><li>For service menus accessed via the remote control, service information is
 almost a necessity since adjustment procedures vary widely and it is all too
 easy to totally mess things up - even to the point of inflicting serious and
 expensive damage to the set.
<p>
 For information on accessing the service menus if used on your model, see
 the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvadjlost">Setup adjustments lost - TV service
 codes</a>.  However, even if the access procedure is known, get the service
 manual or Sams'!
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If a computer interface is required, you can most probably forget about
 attempting to adjust anything unless you find a friendly shop to provide the
 adapter and walk you through the procedure.  Why would they want to do this?
 Because they know you there is a good chance that you will have to pay them
 to unscramble the mess you created!
</li></ul>
 
<h3><a name="tvfocadj">Focus adjustment</a></h3>

On a decent TV, you should be able to make out the individual scanning
lines.  If they are fuzzy, especially in bright areas, then focus may need
to be adjusted.
<p>
The focus pot is usually located on the flyback transformer or on an
auxiliary panel nearby.  Where there are two adjustment knobs on the flyback
transformer, the top one is generally for focus and the bottom one is for G2.
</p><p>
The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or
the general area or from a terminal on a voltage the multiplier module
(if used).  It is usually a wire by itself going to the little board
on the neck of the CRT.
</p><p>
Let the set warm up for at least half an hour.  Display a good quality
signal.  Turn the user color control all the way down and the brightness
and contrast controls all the way up.  This will be the worst case.  Adjust
the focus control for best overall sharpness - you may not be able to get it
perfect everywhere - center as well as corners.  If best focus is at one
end of the focus pot's range and still not good enough, there may be a
problem in the focus divider, focus pot, or some related component.

</p><h3><a name="tvadjscc">Adjustment of the internal SCREEN and color controls</a></h3>

The screen should be adjusted with a white pattern (snow from the tuner 
should do or turn the user COLOR control all the way down to get a
black and white picture).  Put the set in Service mode (horizontal line)
if it has such a switch in the back or inside.  If not, just use
the raster in a darkened room.  Adjust screen for a dim white 
line (raster).  If the line is not white at its dimmest point, you will
need to adjust the drive and cutoff controls for R, G, &amp; B.  
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the following procedure:
</p><p>
Turn R, G, and B screen (or background) controls down. Now turn color 
control fully counterclockwise -- off. Now turn up red screen until the 
screen just shows a red hue. Now turn red gun down until red tint just goes 
away. Now do the same with the green and blue screen controls. Now adjust the 
two DRIVE controls for the best black and white picture. That`s all there is 
to it. I don`t like to work with just a thin "SETUP" line. Cartoons seem to 
be the best thing to have on while doing the above procedure. You can 
also use just plain snow (no program) if you prefer. If you can obtain a 
good b@w pic. when you`re  done, the tube is good and the set if most 
likely functioning properly. Be patient and go slow while watching the 
large mirror that you are using during this procedure. (LEE)

</p><h3><a name="tvoptsbb">Optimal procedure for setting brightness/background and screen adjustments</a></h3>

For slight tweaks, the following is not necessary.  However, if someone
turned all the internal controls or if you are making significant changes
that affect G2 (screen), then following the procedure below is desirable
to achieve best performance and maximize life of the CRT.
<p>
The typical user controls - brightness and contrast can, of course, be set
arbitrarily, depending on video content and ambient lighting conditions.
</p><p>
Set the user brightness and contrast controls in the middle for the following
adjustments and let the set warm up for 20 minutes or so.
</p><p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
Now the screen control, that's another matter. It sets the voltage
on the second grid of the electron guns, typically between +500 and
+1000 V. You will want to use a well-isolated screwdriver for that
if it is a naked potentiometer. In the old days there used to be 3
separate potentiometers for 3 G2s, now there is generally only one.
</p><p>
Its purpose is to set the cutoff voltage for the guns, i.e. the
voltage between K and G1 at which the beam is just off.  The higher
you set the VG2, the higher VK - VG1 must be to cut off the beam.
</p><p>
If you set VG2 too low then your picture will be dark. You can
compensate for that with the brightness control, which in effect will
lower the VKs.  A disadvantage is that you will not get optimum
sharpness and peak brightness from your picture tube.
</p><p>
If you set VG2 too high then your picture will be bright. You can
compensate for that with the brightness control, which in effect will
raise the VKs. You might even get retrace lines which can usually
not be made to disappear with the brightness control. Another 
disadvantage is that you will not get optimum LIFETIME from your 
picture tube. With a too high cutoff voltage the cathode (electron 
emitting surface) will wear out too soon.
</p><p>
You will need to see the picture tube specifications (or possibly
the Sams' Photofact or service manual for the set --- sam) in order to
find the correct setting for the cutoff voltage. This is measured
as VK - VG1 (for each channel RGB) and is typically 130-160 V max.
There will be spread between the 3 channels, typically the highest
of the 3 measured values will be set against the upper limit.
</p><p>
The usual adjustment procedure is as follows:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use any low-level adjustments to set a black picture with all 3
 cathode voltages at the specified level (e.g. 130 V) above
 the VG1 voltage (may be 0 V or 12 V or 20 V ?).  (These are typically
 called RGB brightness, bias, or background level and are often on the
 little board on the neck of the CRT but not always --- sam).
<p>
</p></li><li>Adjust VG2 (screen) until one colour just starts too light up,
 turn it back down until the screen is just black again.  (Occasionally,
 there are two G2 controls - one on the flyback and another on the CRT neck
 board or elsewhere.  If so, they control are basically in series - leave the
 one on the flyback alone if the other one has enough range.)
<p>
</p></li><li>Now adjust 2 of the 3 low-level black controls until the
 other 2 colours just light up, and then back to black again.
<p>
</p></li><li>Select a white picture and use 2 low-level white (RGB drive or gain, also
 generally on the neck board --- sam) controls to set the proper colour
 temperature for white to your own taste.
<p>
</p></li><li>Check your black calibration again, may have to iterate a bit.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvcbadj">Color balance adjustment</a></h3>

Color balance needs adjustment if the highlights and/or shadows of a black
and white picture (turn the color control all the way down) are not a
perfectly neutral gray.
<p>
Note: Some TV designs (Zenith uses this in a few models) automatically balance
CRT cathode drive by sensing emission from the red, green, and blue guns using
a gray scale reference pulse outside the viewable picture.  If this is the
case with your set, there may be no user OR service adjustments :-(.  A color
balance problem in this case means either a failure of this circuitry or a CRT
where the emission from the 3 cathodes is so unbalanced (usually due to one
being much much weaker than the others) that compensation is not possible.
</p><p>
To adjust the color balance:  Turn the color control all the way down so that
you get what should be a B/W picture.  Set the user brightness and contrast
controls about mid-range.  The tint control should not matter (if it does
at this point, you have other chroma problems or an 'autocolor' switch
is on limiting the range of some controls).
</p><p>
Adjust the sub-brightness controls (may be called color screen, background,
or the like) so that the dark areas of the picture are just visible and
neutral gray.  Then, adjust the color gain controls until the brightest areas
are neutral white but not so bright that there is 'color bleeding' in
the highlights.

This should get you close.  If something is still shifting after warmup and
get some cold-spray or even a little blower and try to locate the component
that is drifting.  Most likely a transistor or capacitor.

If you don't know how to access the color and tint controls on your TV and
are happy with green flesh tones and cartoon colors, you can skip this
section.  Most people can adjust their color and tint controls resulting
in a reasonable hue and saturation.  However, here are some ways of getting
closer to perfection.
<p>
(From: Chris Johnson (wjohnson@palmnet.net).)
</p><p>
If you have access to a DVD player, get the 'Video Essentials' DVD and follow
the directions.
</p><p>
If you have access to a LaserDisc player, get 'A Video Standard' and follow
the directions.
</p><p>
But, here are a few quick pointers:
</p><p>
Back off the color control all the way on a program.  Set the color balance
for a true grey appearance without any bias toward red, green, or blue. (Or
any other color.)
</p><p>
Max brightness should not be high enough that vertical lines (like the needle
pulse on the test LD or DVD) don't bend.
</p><p>
On the test pattern with the multicolored bars, the large bars should have
the following colors:  white (actually grey, but fairly light), yellow, cyan,
green, purple, red, blue.
</p><p>
The purpose of the narrow bars just below the large bars is to match up the
tint balance.  You  do this with a blue filter, or killing the R and G guns.
The narrow bars will be exactly the same intensity as the large bars above
them, if the color and tint balance is correct.
</p><p>
Here's a quick trick if you're lucky enough to have a set with separate gun
killer switches for R, G, and B guns:   When properly set, the narrow bars
will be the same intensity as the large bars above them, if you only turn one
gun on at a time.  First do red, then green, then blue.  Go through the
process once and you'll  never forget what it looks like.
</p><p>
Last point:  The pluge bar (in the lower right section of the color bar
screen) should NOT be visible, being ten percent below black level.  If you
can see it, back off the brightness.
</p><p>
Remember:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Brightness sets black level, it should ideally be as black as the screen
 itself, no more, no less.
<p>
</p></li><li>Contrast sets white level.  Too bright and vertical lines start to bend.
<p>
Using just these concepts, you can get REAL close to a proper alignment.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
Most people set the color too high.  News programs should NOT be as colorful
as the movie 'Jingle All The Way'.  (Which, by  the way, is a real test of
your TV's abilities.)  Most people's faces should not be red.
</p><p>
You know you have it all set right when black clothing on people on TV has
texture and depth to it, and also when purple and blue are two distinct
colors.  Some TV sets don't do that very well as shipped.

</p><h3><a name="tvhpssla">Horizontal position, size, and linearity adjustment</a></h3>

Horizontal position may be set via a switch or jumper, a pot, or (mostly
in B/W TVs) a set of rings on the CRT neck.
<p>
Horizontal size should be set so that there is about 10-15 percent
overscan left and right.  This will allow ample margin for power line
voltage fluctuations, component aging, and the reduction in raster size
that may occur with some VCR special effects (fast play) modes.
</p><p>
Many sets no longer have any horizontal size adjustments and depend on
accurate regulation of the voltage to the horizontal output stage
to control horizontal size.  There may be a B+ adjustment to perform
first.
</p><p>
On those that do, the adjustment may either be done by setting the B+
voltage, by a pot, or a width coil in series with the horizontal
deflection coils.
</p><p>
Modern sets do not generally have any linearity control but you may find
this on older models.  You will need to go back and forth between size
and linearity as these adjustments are usually not independent.
</p><p>
Some of the newest sets control all these parameters via settings in
non-volatile memory and use service menus accessed via the remote control
for nearly all setup adjustments.

</p><h3><a name="tvvpsla">Vertical position, size, and linearity adjustment</a></h3>

Vertical position may be set via a switch or jumper, a pot, or (mostly
in B/W TVs) a set of rings on the CRT neck.
<p>
Vertical size should be set so that there is about 10-15 percent
overscan top and bottom.  This will allow ample margin for power line
voltage fluctuations, component aging, and the reduction in raster size
that may occur with some VCR special effects (fast play) modes.
</p><p>
Some sets no longer have any vertical size adjustments and depend on
the accurate regulation of the voltage to the vertical output stage
to control vertical size.
</p><p>
On those that do, the adjustment is usually a pot in the vertical output
circuitry.  If your set has a linearity control, you will need to adjust
this in conjunction with the size control as these are usually not independent.
</p><p>
Some of the newest sets control all these parameters via settings in
non-volatile memory and use service menus accessed via the remote control
for nearly all setup.

</p><h3><a name="tvcolltComments on linearity or lack thereof&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

(From: Jerry Greenberg (jerryg50@hotmail.com).)
&lt;p&gt;
If you can get a grating test generator this would be the proper way
to test for non-linearity.  Using a camera or device other than that
would not be an acceptable reference if you call any engineer from the
manufacture.  If you mention a grating generator, he will certainly
listen.
&lt;p&gt;
You would need the service manual for the model to know the specs.  Some of
these sets can have a non-linearity of up to about 2% near to the edges.  Only
professional broadcast monitors will be down to the 0.5% and less error factor
near to the corners.
&lt;p&gt;
On a 27 inch screen 2% can mean an error of can give a visible non-linearity
of 0.5 inches.  Convergence errors can be as much as 0.25 or 1/4 inch at the
corners.   Generally they are more accurate than these figures.  This is the
worse case that is generally accepted on a consumer TV by the manufactures.
&lt;p&gt;
I have found that on flat screen consumer TV sets, the linearity sort of gets
a bit stretched towards the ends of the scan.   This is because of the beam
angle.  There is compensation for azimuth of beam focus (dynamic focus) and
for the scans to a degree that keeps the price of the TV within consumer
range.
&lt;p&gt;
The screens that are a bit more spherical or rounded will have less of this
effect because it is lower in cost to compensate for these errors.  A true
accurate screen would be one that is spherical following exactly to the beam
angle.  But,  for viewing this would not be very desirable.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;A NAME=" tvpinadj"="">Pincushion adjustments</a></h3>

There may be two controls - amplitude and phase.  Pincushion amplitude
as its name implies, controls the size of the correction.  Pincushion
phase affects where on the sides it is applied.  Don't expect perfection.
<p>
If the controls have no effect, there is probably a fault in the pincushion
correction circuitry.
</p><p>
It is best to make these adjustments with a crosshatch or dot test pattern

</p><h3><a name="tvgeoadj">Geometry adjustment</a></h3>

This refers to imperfections in the shape of the picture not handled
by the pincushion and size adjustments.  These types of defects include
trapezoidal or keystone shaped raster and jogs or wiggles around the periphery
of the raster.  Unfortunately, one way these are handled at the factory is to
glue little magnets to strategic locations on the CRT and/or rotate little
magnets mounted on the yoke frame.  Unless you really cannot live with the
way it is (assuming there isn't something actually broken), leave these
alone!  You can end up with worse problems.  In any case, carefully mark the
position AND orientation of every magnet so that if this happens, you can
get back to where you started.  If the magnets are on little swivels, some
experimenting with them one at a time may result in some improvement.  Of
course, it is best to obtain a service manual and follow its instructions.

<h3><a name="tvwcbmmse">Why is the convergence on my set bad near the edges</a></h3>

Very simple - nothing is quite perfect.  Perfect convergence is not
even necessarily possible in theory with the set of adjustments available
on a typical TV.  It is all a matter of compromises.  Consider what
you are trying to do: get three electron beams which originate from
different electron guns to meet at a single point within a fraction
of a mm everywhere on the screen.  This while the beams are scanning
at an effective writing rate of 20,000 mph across the face of a 27" CRT
in a variable magnetic environment manufactured at a price you can afford
without a second mortgage!

<h3><a name="tvcrtpca">CRT purity and convergence problems</a></h3>

Purity assures that each of the beams for the 3 primary colors - red, green,
and blue - strikes only the proper phosphor dots for that color.  A totally
red scene will appear pure red and so forth.  Symptoms of poor purity are
blotches of discoloration on the screen.  Objects will change shades of color
when the move from one part of the screen to another.
<p>
Convergence refers to the control of the instantaneous positions of the red,
green, and blue spots as they scan across the face of the CRT so that they are
as nearly coincident as possible.  Symptoms of poor convergence are colored
borders on solid objects or visible separate R, G, and B images of fine lines
or images,
</p><p>
Note: It is probably best to face the set East-West (front-to-back) when
performing any purity and convergence adjustments.  Since you probably do not
know what orientation will eventually be used, this is the best compromise
as the earth's magnetic field will be aligned mostly across the CRT.  This will
minimize the possible rotation of the picture when the unit is moved to its
final position but there may be a position shift.  Neither of these is that
significant so it probably doesn't really matter that much unless you are
super fussy.  Of course, if you know the final orientation of the TV in your
entertainment center - and you don't expect to be redecorating, use that
instead.  Or, plan to do the final tilt and position adjustments after the set
is in position - but this will probably require access to the inside!
</p><p>
First, make sure no sources of strong magnetic fields are in the vicinity of
the TV - loudspeakers, refrigerator magnets, MRI scanners, etc.  A nearby
lightning strike or EMP from a nuclear explosion can also affect purity.
</p><p>
Cycle power a couple of times to degauss the CRT (1 minute on, 20 minutes
off) - see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a
CRT</a>.  If the built in degaussing circuits have no effect, use an external
manual degaussing coil.
</p><p>
Assuming this doesn't help, you will need to set the internal purity
and/or convergence adjustments on the CRT.  Modern CRTs usually use a
combination of a series of magnetized moveable rings on the neck, and yoke
position and orientation to set purity and convergence.
</p><p>
First, mark the positions of all adjustments - use white paint, 'White out',
or a Magic Marker on the ring magnets on the neck of the CRT, the position
and tilt of the deflection yoke, and any other controls that you may touch
deliberately or by accident.
</p><p>
However, if your set is still of the type with a drawer or panel of knobs
for these adjustments, don't even think about doing anything without
a service manual and follow it to the letter unless the functions of all
the knobs is clearly marked (some manufacturers actually do a pretty good
job of this).
</p><p>
Note: some CRTs do not have any adjustable rings for purity (and static
convergence).  Either an internal structure in the neck of the CRT or an
external 'permalloy' sleeve is permanently magnetized at the factory and
there is not way of tweaking it in the field.  However, it may be possible
to use a normal set of magnet rings in addition to or in place of it to
correct for purity or convergence problems due to loss of magnetism due
to age or someone waving a 10 pound magnet near the CRT neck!

</p><h3><a name="tvcrtpura">CRT purity adjustment</a></h3>

Purity on modern CRTs is usually set by a combination of a set of ring
magnets just behind the deflection yoke on the neck of the CRT and the
position of the yoke fore-aft.  As always, mark the starting position of
all the rings and make sure you are adjusting the correct set if rings!
<p>
Use the following purity adjustment procedure as a general guide only.
Depending on the particular model TV, the following purity adjustment
procedure may substitute green for red depending on the arrangement of the
guns in the CRT.  This description is based on the Sams' Photofact for the RCA
CTC111C chassis which uses a slot-mask CRT.  The procedures for dot-mask
and Trinitron (aperture grille) CRTs will vary slightly.  See you service
manual!
</p><p>
Obtain a white raster (sometimes there is a test point that can be grounded
to force this).  Then, turn down the bias controls for blue and green so
that you have a pure red raster.  Let the set warm up for a minimum of
15 minutes.
</p><p>
Loosen the deflection yoke clamp and move the yoke as far back as it will go,
</p><p>
Adjust the purity magnets to center the red vertical raster on the screen.
</p><p>
Move the yoke forward until you have the best overall red purity.
</p><p>
Now, move the yoke forward until you have the best overall red purity.
Tighten the clamp securely and reinstall the rubber wedges (if you set
has these) to stabilize the yoke position.  Reset the video adjustments
you touched to get a red raster.

</p><h3><a name="tvcrtcona">CRT convergence adjustment</a></h3>

In the good old days when TVs were TVs (and not just a picture tube with
a little circuit board attached) there were literally drawers full of
knobs for setting convergence.  One could spend hours and still end up
with a less than satisfactory picture.  As the technology progressed,
the number of electronic adjustments went down drastically so that today
there are very few if any.
<p>
Unless you want a lot of frustration, I would recommend not messing with
convergence.  You could end up a lot worse.  I have no idea what is used
for convergence on your set but convergence adjustments are never
quite independent of one another.  You could find an adjustment that
fixes the problem you think you have only to discover some other area
of the screen is totally screwed.  In addition, there are adjustments
for geometry and purity and maybe others that you may accidentally move
without even knowing it until you have buttoned up the set.
</p><p>
Warning: Accurately mark the original positions - sometimes you will change
something that will not have an obvious effect but will be noticeable
later on.  So it is extremely important to be able to get back to where
you started.  If only red/green vertical lines are offset, then it is
likely that only a single ring needs to be moved - and by just a hair.
But, you may accidentally move something else!
</p><p>
If you really cannot live with it, make sure you mark everything very
carefully so you can get back to your current state.  A service manual is
essential!
</p><p>
Convergence is set using a white crosshatch or dot test pattern.  If you
do not have a test pattern generator, any static scene (from a camcorder
or previously recorded tape, for example) with a lot of fine detail will
suffice.  Turn the color control all the way down so you have a B/W picture.
</p><p>
Static convergence sets the beams to be coincident in the exact center of
the screen.  This is done using a set of ring magnets behind the purity
magnets on the CRT neck.
</p><p>
From the Sams' for the RCA CTC111C: "adjust the center set of magnets to
converge blue to green at the center of the screen.  Adjust the rear set
of magnets to converge red to green at the center of the screen."  Your
set may have a slightly different procedure.
</p><p>
Dynamic convergence adjusts for coincidence at the edges and corners.
</p><p>
On old tube, hybrid, and early solid state TVs, dynamic convergence was
accomplished with electronic adjustments of which there may have been
a dozen or more that were not independent.  With modern sets, all convergence
is done with magnet rings on the neck of the CRT, magnets glued to the CRT,
and by tilting the deflection yoke.  The clamp in conjunction with rubber
wedges or set screws assures that the yoke remains in position.
</p><p>
From the Sams' for the RCA CTC111C: "Loosen the screws at the 6 o'clock and
10 o'clock positions to permit the yoke to be tilted vertically.  Rock yoke
up and down to converge the right and left sides of the screen.  Tighten screw
at 6 o'clock and loosen screw at 3 o'clock to permit the yoke to be tilted
horizontally.  Rock yoke from side to side to converge the top and bottom
of the screen.  Tighten screws at 3 o'clock and 10 o'clock."
</p><p>
Many sets simply use the main clamp which locks the yoke to the neck of the
CRT in conjunction with rubber wedges between the yoke and the funnel of
the CRT to stabilize the yoke position position.
</p><p>
Refer to your service manual.  (Is this beginning to sound repetitious?)
</p><p>
For additional comments on convergence adjustments, see the sections: "Tony's
notes on setting convergence on delta gun CRTs" and "Saga and General setup
for large CRT TVs".

</p><h3><a name="tvtiltpic">Tilted picture</a></h3>

You have just noticed that the picture on your fancy (or cheap) TV
is not quite horizontal - not aligned with the front bezel.  Note that
often there is some keystoning as well where the top and bottom or left and
right edges of the picture are not quite parallel - which you may never
have noticed until now.  Since this may not be correctable, adjusting
tilt may represent a compromise at best between top/bottom or left/right
alignment of the picture edges.   You may never sleep again knowing that
your TV picture is not perfect!  BTW, I can sympathize with your unhappiness.
Nothing is more annoying than a just noticeable imperfection such as this.
However, since TVs always overscan, the only time you will really notice a
minor tilt without going out of your way to look for it is if there is text
or graphics near the edge of the screen.
<p>
There are several possible causes for a tilted picture:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Set orientation.  The horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field
 affects this slgithly.  Therefore, if you rotate the TV you may be able
 to correct the tilt.  Of course, it will probably want to face the wall!
<p>
 Other external magnetic fields can sometimes cause a rotation without any
 other obvious effects - have you changed the TV's location?  Did an MRI
 scanner move in next door?
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Need for degaussing.  Most of the time, magnetization of the CRT will
 result in color problems which will be far more obvious than a slight
 rotation.  However, internal or external shields or other metal parts in
 the set could become magnetized resulting a tilt.  More extensive treatment
 than provided by the built-in degaussing coil may be needed.  Even, the
 normal manual degaussing procedure may not be enough to get close enough
 to all the affected parts.
<p>
</p></li><li>You just became aware of it but nothing has changed.  Don't dismiss this
 offhand.  It is amazing how much we ignore unless it is brought to our
 attention.  Are you a perfectionist?
<p>
</p></li><li>There is an external tilt control which may be misadjusted.  Newer Sony 
 monitors have this (don't know about TVs) - a most wonderful addition.
 Too bad about the stabilizing wires on Trinitron CRTs.  A digital control
 may have lost its memory accidentally.  The circuitry could have a problem.
<p>
</p></li><li>There is an internal tilt control that is misadjusted or not functioning.
 The existance of such a control is becoming more common.
<p>
</p></li><li>The deflection yoke on the CRT has gotten rotated or was not oriented
 correctly at the time of the set's manufacture.  Sometimes, the entire yoke
 is glued in place in addition to being clamped adding another complication.
<p>
 If the TV was recently bumped or handled roughly, the yoke may have been
 knocked out of position.  But in most cases, the amount of abuse required
 to do this with the yoke firmly clamped and/or glued would have totally
 destroyed the set in the process.
</p><p>
 There is a risk (in addition to the risk of frying yourself on the various
 voltages present inside an operating TV) of messing up the convergence
 or purity when fiddling with the yoke or anything around it since the yoke
 position on the neck of the tube and its tilt may affect purity and
 convergence.  Tape any rubber wedges under the yoke securely in place
 as these will maintain the proper position and tilt of the yoke while you
 are messing with it.  (Don't assume the existing tape will hold - the
 adhesive is probably dry and brittle).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>The CRT may have rotated slightly with respect to the front bezel.
 Irrespective of the cause of the tilt, sometimes it is possible to
 loosen the 4 (typical) CRT mounting screws and correct the tilt by
 slightly rotating the CRT.  This may be easier than rotating the yoke.
 Just make sure to take proper safety precautions when reaching inside!
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvbwtspga">B/W TV size, position, and geometry adjustments</a></h3>

These tend to be a lot simpler and less critical than for color monitors
or TV sets.
<p>
On a B/W TV you will probably see some of the following adjustments:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Position - a pair of rings with tabs on the neck of the CRT.
 There may be electronic position adjustements as well though this
 is not that common on small TVs.
<p>
</p></li><li>Width and height (possibly linearity as well) controls.  There may be
 some interaction between size and linearity - a crosshatch test pattern
 is best for this.  Vertical adjustments are almost always pots while
 horizontal (if they exist) may be pots and/or coils.  Size will normally
 be set for 5-10% overscan to account for line voltage fluctuations and
 component drift.  Confirm aspect ratio with test pattern which includes
 square boxes.
<p>
</p></li><li>Geometry - some little magnets either on swivels around the yoke or
 glued to the CRT.  If these shifted, the the edges may have gotten
 messed up - wiggles, dips, concave or convex shapes.  There may be
 a doxen or more each mostly affecting a region around the edge of the
 raster.  However, they will not be totally independent.
</li></ol>
<p>
Check at extremes of brightness/contrast as there may be some slight
changes in size and position due to imperfect HV regulation.
</p><p>
There may be others as well but without a service manual, there is no
way of knowing for sure.  Sams' often has folders for B/W TVs.
</p><p>
Just mark everything carefully before changing - then you will be able to
get back where you started.

<h2>Low Voltage Power Supply Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvlvpsf">Low voltage power supply fundamentals</a></h3>

TVs require a variety of voltages (at various power levels) to function.
The function of the low voltage power supply is to take the AC line input
of either 115 VAC 60 Hz (220 VAC 50 Hz or other AC power in Europe and
elsewhere) and produce some of these DC voltages.  In all cases, the power
to the horizontal output transistor of the horizontal deflection system
is obtained directly from the low voltage power supply.  In some cases,
a variety of other DC voltages are derived directly from the AC line by
rectification, filtering, and regulation.  In other designs, however, most
of the low voltages are derived from secondary windings on the flyback
(LOPT) transformer of the horizontal deflection system.  In still other
designs, there is a separate switchmode power supply that provides some or
all of these voltages.  There are also various (and sometimes convoluted)
combinations of any or all of the above.
<p>
There will always be:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>A power switch, relay, or triac to enable main power.
<p>
</p></li><li>A set of rectifiers - usually in a bridge configuration - to turn the
 AC into DC.  Small ceramic capacitors are normally placed across the
 diodes to reduce RF interference.
<p>
</p></li><li>One or more large filter capacitors to smooth the unregulated DC.  In
 the U.S., this is most often a voltage around 150-160 V DC.  In countries
 with 220 VAC power, it will typically be around 300-320 V DC.
<p>
</p></li><li>A discrete, hybrid, or IC regulator to provide stable DC to the horizontal
 deflection system.  Sometimes feedback from a secondary output of the
 flyback or even the high voltage is used.  This regulator may be either
 a linear or switching type.  In some cases, there is no regulator.
<p>
</p></li><li>Zero or more voltage dividers and/or regulators to produce additional
 voltages directly from the line power.  This relatively rare except for
 startup circuits.  These voltages will not be isolated from the line.
<p>
</p></li><li>A degauss control circuit usually including a thermistor or Posistor
 (a combination of a heater disk and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC)
 thermistor in a single package). When power is turned on, a relatively
 high AC current is applied to the degauss coil wrapped around the periphery
 of the CRT.  The PTC thermister heats up, increases in resistance, and
 smoothly decreases the current to nearly zero over a couple of seconds.
<p>
</p></li><li>A startup circuit for booting the horizontal deflection if various voltages
 to run the TV are derived from the flyback.  This may be an IC or discrete
 multivibrator or something else running off a non-isolated voltage or
 the standby power supply.
<p>
</p></li><li>A standby power supply for the microcontroller and remote sensor.  Usually,
 this is a separate low voltage power supply using a small power transformer
 for line isolation.  However, some sets use other (probably cheaper)
 approaches.  See below.
</li></ol>
<p>
Always use an isolation transformer when working on a TV but this is
especially important - for your safety - when dealing with the non-isolated
line operated power supply.  Read and follow the information in the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsafg">Safety guidelines</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvstndbyp">Standby power supplies</a></h3>

Where the TV has a remote control (which most do nowadays), there needs to
be some source of voltage(s) for the remote receiver, microcontroller, and
other circuitry that watch for the 'power on' commend.  These sets are never
totally off.
<p>
The standby supply may consist of:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>A low voltage power transformer feeding one or more sets of rectifiers,
 filter capacitors, and possibly regulators.
<p>
 A power surge could cause the primary of the transformer to open up.
 There may also be a thermal fuse under the outer layers of insulation
 which blew either due to overheating or a power surge.  However, if the
 primary is open, it is best to replace the transformer rather than
 attempting repair it.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>One or more voltage dividers connected directly to the AC line feeding
 rectifiers, filter capacitors, and possibly regulators.
<p>
 Open resistors and dried up capacitors are common failures since the
 resistors are often not rated adequately and run hot, in close proximity
 to the capacitors.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>A portion of the main (switchmode) power supply that runs all the time.
<p>
 Failures could be almost anything that would affect normal operation of
 the power supply as well as problems with the control circuitry.
</p></li></ul>

The partial schematic below is similar to those found in the majority of
TVs sold in countries with 110 to 120 VAC power.  Many parts are not shown

</p></li><li>The line fuse is typically 2 to 4 A, usually a normal fast blow type.  Even
 so, it may not blow as a result of faults down the line - the fusable

<h3><a name="tvtotdead">Totally dead set</a></h3>

This can be as simple as a bad outlet (including blown fuse or tripped circuit
breaker due to some other fault), switched outlet and the switch is off, or
bad cordset.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Plug a lamp into the outlet to make sure it is live.  If the lamp works,
 then the problem is the TV.  It not, the outlet is defective or the fuse is
 blown or the circuit breaker is tripped.  There is another very simple
 explanation that is sometimes overlooked:  This is a switched outlet.  You
 always wondered what that wall switch was for that didn't seem to do anything
 and you flipped randomly. :-)  Well, now you know!
<p>
</p></li><li>Try wiggling the TV's cord both at the outlet (also push the wire toward
 the plug) and TV (also push the cord toward the TV) with the set on and/or
 while pressing the power-on button.  If you can get a response, even
 momentarily, the cord likely has broken wires internally.
</li></ul>
<p>
Beyond these basic causes, troubleshooting will be needed inside the set to
determine what is defective.  Also see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvintdead">Intermittently dead set - bad cordset</a>.
               
</p><h3><a name="tvintdead">Intermittently dead set - bad cordset</a></h3>

There are two problems which are common with the line cord on appliances.
Don't overlook these really simple things when troubleshooting your vacuum
cleaner - or fancy electronic equipment!  If wiggling the cord has an effect,
then the following are likely causes:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Repeated flexing results in the internal conductors breaking either at
 the plug or appliance end.  If flexing the cord/squeezing/pulling results
 in the device going on and off, it is bad.  If the problem is at the plug
 end, cut off the old plug a couple of inches beyond the problem area and
 replace just he plug.  If the problem is at the appliance end, an entire
 new cordset is best though you can probably cut out the bad section and
 solder what remains directly to the mainboard.
<p>
 In either case, observe the polarity of the cord wires - they will be marked
 in some way with a ridge or stripe.  It is important that the new plug be
 of the same type (polarized usually) and that the cord is wired the same
 way.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>The prongs do not fit snugly into older worn outlets.  This can usually
 be remedied by using a pointed tool like an awl or utility knife to spread
 apart the pair of leaves often used to form each prong of the plug.  If
 the prongs are made of solid metal, it may be possible to spread them
 apart - widen the space between them.  Alternatively, get a 3 to 2 prong
 adapter just to use as an intermediate connector.  Spread the leaves of
 its prongs.  However, a new outlet is best.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad connections on the mainboard.  As you flex the cord, it is also
 stressing the attachment to the mainboard and affecting some marginal solder
 joints.
</li></ul>
<p>
It is important to deal with these symptoms as soon as possible as erratic
power cycling can lead to much more serious and expensive problems down the
road.

</p><h3><a name="tvpbosif">Power button on set is flakey</a></h3>

If the on/off (or other button) on the set itself behaves erratically
but the remote control works fine, then it could be a dirty button or
cable or other connections to the switch PCB, particularly if the buttons
on the set itself are rarely used.  There could possibly be a bad pullup
resistor or something of that sort - but is it worth the effort to locate?
<p>
Why not just continue to use the remote?  There is no reason to suspect that
it will develop similar symptoms.  However, there is some risk that if
the button is dirty, you may find the TV coming on at random times in the
middle of the night (of course!).
</p><p>
I think I have an older Sylvania that does that sort of thing - don't
really know as I never use the power button on the set!
</p><p>
If power is controlled by a hard switch - a pull or click knob, or mechanical
push-push switch and this has become erratic due to worn contacts,
replacements are available but often only directly from the original
manufacturer to physically fit and (where applicable) have the volume
or other controls built in.  As an alternative, consider mounting a small
toggle switch on the side of the cabinet to substitute for the broken switch.
This will almost certainly be easier and cheaper - and quite possibly, more
reliable.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvbfuse">TV blows fuse</a></h3>

A blown fuse is a very common type of fault due to poor design very often
triggered by power surges due to outages or lightning storms.  However,
the most likely parts to short are easily tested, usually in-circuit, with
an ohmmeter and then easily removed to confirm.
<p>
Note that it *may be* useful to replace a fuse the *first* time it blows
(though it would be better to do some basic checks for shorted components
first as there is a small chance that having a fuse blow the second time could
result in additional damage which would further complicate the troubleshooting
process).  However, if the new one blows, there is a real problem and the only
use in feeding the TV fuses will be to keep the fuse manufacturer in business!
</p><p>
Sometimes, a fuse will just die of old age or be zapped by a power surge that
caused no damage to the rest of the TV.  However, it must be an EXACT
replacement (including slo-blow if that is what was there originally).  Else,
there could be safety issues (e.g., fire hazard or equipment damage from too
large a current rating) or you could be chasing a non-existent problem
(e.g., if the new fuse is not slo-blow and is blown by the degauss circuit
inrush current but nothing is actually wrong).
</p><p>
If the fuse really blows absolutely instantly with no indication that the
circuits are functioning (no high pitched horizontal deflection whine (if
your dog hides under the couch whenever the TV is turned on, deflection
is probably working).) then this points to a short somewhere quite near
the AC power input.  The most common places would be:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Degauss Posistor - very likely.
</li><li>Horizontal output transistor.
</li><li>Power supply regulator if there is one.
</li><li>Power supply chopper (switchmode) transistor if there is one.
</li><li>Diode(s) in main bridge
</li><li>Main filter capacitor(s).
</li></ul>
<p>
You should be able to eliminate these one by one.
</p><p>
Unplug the degauss coil as this will show up as a low resistance.
</p><p>
First, measure across the input to the main power rectifiers - it
should not be that low.  A reading of only a few ohms may mean a
shorted rectifier or two or a shorted Posistor.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Test the rectifiers individually or remove and retest the resistance.
<p>
</p></li><li>Some sets use a Posistor for degauss control.  This is a little cubical
 (about 1/2" x 3/4" x 1") component with 3 legs.  It includes a line
 operated heater disk (which often shorts out) and a PTC thermister to
 control current to the degauss coil.  Remove the posistor and try power.
 If the monitor now works, obtain a replacement but in the meantime you
 just won't have the automatic degauss.
<p>

If these test good, use an ohmmeter with the set unplugged to measure
the horizontal output transistor.  Even better to remove it and measure it.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>C-E should be high in at least one direction.
</li><li>B-E may be high or around 50 ohms but should not be near 0.
</li></ul>
<p>
If any readings are under 5 ohms, the transistor is bad.  The parts
sources listed at the end of this document will have suitable replacements.
</p><p>
If the HOT tests bad, try powering the set first with your light bulb and if
it just flashes once when the capacitor is charging, then put a fuse in
and try it.  The fuse should not blow with the transistor removed.
</p><p>
Of course, not much else will work either.
</p><p>
If it tests good, power the set without the transistor and see what happens.
If the fuse does not blow, then with the good transistor (assuming it is not
failing under load), it would mean that there is some problem with the
driving circuits possibly or with the feedback from the voltages derived
from the horizontal not regulating properly.
</p><p>
Look inside the TV and see if you can locate any other large power transistors
in metal (TO3) cans or plastic (TOP3) cases.  There may be a separate
transistor that does the low voltage regulation or a separate regulator
IC.  Some TVs have a switchmode power supply that runs off a different
transistor than the HOT.  There is a chance that one of these may be bad.
If it is a simple transistor, the same ohmmeter check should be performed.
</p><p>
If none of this proves fruitful, it may be time to try to locate a schematic.
</p><p>
A blown fuse is a very common type of fault due to poor design very often
triggered by power surges due to outages or lightning storms.  However,
the most likely parts to short are easily tested, usually in-circuit, with
an ohmmeter and then easily removed to confirm.
</p><p>
If you find the problem and repair it yourself, the cost is likely to
be under $25.

</p><h3><a name="tvfbotbus">Fuse blows or TV blows up when sync is disrupted</a></h3>

This is a problem which is not going to be easy to identify.  One possibility
is a drive problem.  The messed up sync resulting from swtiching channels,
or changing input connections might be resulting in an excessively long scan
time for just one scan line.  However, this may be enough to cause a current
spike in the horizontal output circuit or an excessive voltage spike on the
collector of the horizontal output transistor.  Normally, the HOT current
ramps up during scan.  During flyback, the current is turned off.  This
current is normally limited and the voltage spike on the collector of the
HOT is also limited by the snubber capacitors to a safe value.  If scan time
is too long, current continues to increase.  At some point, the flyback core
saturates and current goes way up.  In addition, the voltage spike will be
much higher - perhaps destructively so.
<p>
Troubleshooting these sorts of problems is going to be tough.  However,
a likely area to investigate would be:
</p><p>

</p></li><li>Drive circuitry for the HOT including the coupling components.
<p>
</p></li><li>The chip that generates takes the sync input and generates the horizontal
 drive signal.
<p>
</p></li><li>A bad low voltage regulator might permit the B+ to rise to excessive levels
 during black scenes (i.e., video mute during channel changing).


<h3><a name="tvifbdls">Internal fuse blew during lightning storm (or elephant hit power pole)</a></h3>

Power surges or nearby lightning strikes can destroy electronic equipment.
However, most of the time, damage is minimal or at least easily repaired.
With a direct hit, you may not recognize what is left of it!
<p>
Ideally, electronic equipment should be unplugged (both AC line and phone
line!) during electrical storms if possible.  Modern TVs, VCRs, microwave
ovens, and even stereo equipment is particularly susceptible to lightning and
surge damage because some parts of the circuitry are always alive and therefore
have a connection to the AC line.  Telephones, modems, and faxes are directly
connected to the phone lines.  Better designs include filtering and surge
suppression components built in.  With a near-miss, the only thing that may
happen is for the internal fuse to blow or for the microcontroller to go
bonkers and just require power cycling.  There is no possible protection
against a direct strike.  However, devices with power switches that totally
break the line connection are more robust since it takes much more voltage
to jump the gap in the switch than to fry electronic parts.  Monitors and
TVs may also have their CRTs magnetized due to the electromagnetic fields
associated with a lightning strike - similar but on a smaller scale to
the EMP of a nuclear detonation.
</p><p>
Was the TV operating or on standby at the time?  If it was switched
off using an actual power switch (not a logic pushbutton or the remote
control), then either a component in front of the switch has blown, the
surge was enough to jump the gap between the switch contacts, or it was
just a coincidence (yeh, right).
</p><p>
If the TV was operating or on standby or has no actual power switch, then
a number of parts could be fried.
</p><p>
TVs usually have their own internal surge protection devices like MOVs (Metal
Oxide Varistors) after the fuse.  So it is possible that all that is wrong is
that the line fuse has blown.  Remove the cover (unplug it first!) and start
at the line cord.  If you find a blown fuse, remove it and measure across
the in-board side of fuse holder and the other (should be the neutral) side
of the line.  The ohmmeter reading should be fairly high - well certainly not
less than 100 ohms - in at least one direction.  You may need to unplug the
degaussing coil to get a reasonable reading as its resistance may be 25 or 30
ohms.  If the reading is really low, there are other problems.  If the
resistance checks out, replace the fuse and try powering the TV.  There will
be 3 possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>It will work fine, problem solved.
<p>
</p></li><li>It will immediately blow the fuse.  This means there is at least one
 component shorted - possibilities include an MOV, line rectifiers, main
 filter cap, regulator transistor, horizontal output transistor, etc.  You
 will need to check with your ohmmeter for shorted semiconductors.  Remove
 any that are suspect and see of the fuse now survives (use the series
 light bulb to cut your losses - see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtslbt">The
 series light bulb trick</a>.
<p>
</p></li><li>It will not work properly or appear dead.  This could mean there are
 open fusable resistors other defective parts in the power supply or
 elsewhere.  In this case further testing will be required and at some
 point you may need the schematic.
</li></ol>
<p>
If the reading is very low or the fuse blows again, see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtvbfuse">TV blows fuse</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvfrbtcpo">Fuse replaced but TV clicks with power-on but no other action</a></h3>

The click probably means that the power relay is working, though there could
be bad contacts.
<p>
Since the fuse doesn't blow now (you did replace it with one of the same
ratings, right?), you need to check for:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Other blown fuses - occasionally there are more than one in a TV.
<p>
 Replace with one of exactly the same ratings.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Open fusable resistors.  These sometimes blow at the same time or in
 place of the fuses.  They are usually low values like 2 ohms and are in
 big rectangular ceramic power resistor cases or smaller blue or gray
 colored cylindrical power resistors.  They are supposed to protect
 expensive parts like the HOT but often blow at the same time.
</li></ul>
<p>
If any of these are bad, they will need to be replaced with flameproof
resistors of the same ratings (though you can substitute an ordinary
resistor for testing purposes).  Before applying power, check: Rectifier
diodes, horizontal output transistor, regulator pass or chopper transistor
(if present), and main filter capacitor for shorts.
</p><p>
An initial test with an ohmmeter can be done while in-circuit.  The
resistance across each diode and the collector to emitter of the
transistors should be relatively high - a few hundred ohms at lest -
in at least one direction (in-circuit).  If there is a question, unsolder
one side of each diode and check - should be in the Megohms or higher in
one direction.  Removed from the circuit, the collector-emitter resistance
should be very high in one direction at least.  Depending on the type,
the base-emitter resistance may be high in one direction or around 50 ohms.
If any reading on a semiconductor device is under 10 ohms - then the device
most likely bad.  Assuming that you do not have a schematic, you should
be able to locate the rectifiers near where the line cord is connected and
trace the circuit.  The transistors will be either in a TO3 large metal can
or a TOP3 plastic package - on heat sinks.  The filter capacitor should
eventually measure high in one direction (it will take a while to charge
from your ohmmeter).   It could still be failing at full voltage, however.
</p><p>
If you find one bad part, still check everything else as more than one part
may fail and just replacing one may cause it to fail again.
</p><p>
Assuming everything here checks out, clip a voltmeter set on its 500 V scale
or higher across the horizontal output transistor and turn the power on.
Warning - never measure this point if the horizontal deflection is operating.
it is ok now since the set is dead.  If the voltage here is 100-150, then
there is a problem in the drive to the horizontal output circuit.  If it
is low or 0, then there are still problems in the power supply or with the
winding on the flyback transformer.
</p><p>
Other possible problems: bad hybrid voltage regulator, bad startup circuit,
bad standby power supply (dried up filter capacitor, etc.) bad relay contacts
as mentioned above.  However, these probably would not have blown the fuse in
the first place so are less likely.

</p><h3><a name="tvpotttccc">Power-on tick-tick-tick or click-click-click but no other action</a></h3>

A variety of power supply or startup problems can result in this or
similar behavior.  Possibilities include:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Lack of startup horizontal drive - see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvstartupp">Startup problems - nothing happens, click, or
tick-tick-tick sound</a>.  The main regulator is cycling on overvoltage
due to lack of load.
<p>
</p></li><li>Excessive load or faulty power supply cycling on its overcurrent
 protection circuit.
<p>
</p></li><li>High voltage shutdown, or some other system detecting an out of regulation
 condition.  However, in this case, there should be some indication that the
 deflection and HV is attempting to come up - momentary whine, static on the
 screen, etc.
<p>
</p></li><li>A dried up main filter capacitor or other filter capacitor in the low
 voltage power supply that is producing an out-of-regulation condition
 until it warms up.  A bad filter capacitor on the output of a series
 regulator may result in excessive voltage and subsequent shutdown.
<p>
</p></li><li>A problem with the microcontroller, relay or its driver, or standby
 power supply.
</li></ul>
<p>
One possible test would be to vary the line voltage and observe the
set's behavior.  It may work fine at one extreme (usually low) or the
other.  This might give clues as to what is wrong.
</p><p>
Also see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdttttfff">Dead TV with periodic
tweet-tweet, flub-flub, or low-low voltage</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvnopicorns">No picture or raster and no sound</a></h3>

The screen is blank with no raster at all.  There are indications that the
channel numbers are changing in the display.  This indicates that some of the
low voltages are present but these may be derived from the standby supply.
<p>
Assuming there is no deflection and no HV, you either have a low voltage power
supply problem, bad startup circuit, or bad horizontal output transistor
(HOT) or other bad parts in the horizontal deflection.
</p><p>
Check for bad fuses.
</p><p>
(If you have HV as indicated by static electricity on the front of the
screen and you hear the high pitched whine of the horizontal deflection
when it is turned on, then the following does not apply).
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use an ohmmeter to test the HOT for shorts.  If it is bad, look for
 open fusable resistors or other fuses you did not catch.
<p>
</p></li><li>Assuming it is good, measure the voltage on the collector-emitter
 of the HOT (this is safe if there is no deflection).  You should see
 the B+ - probably between 100 and 150 V.
<p>
</p></li><li>If there is no voltage, you have a low voltage power supply problem
 and/or you have not found all the bad/open parts.
<p>
</p></li><li>If there is voltage and no deflection (no high pitched whine and no
 HV), you probably have a startup problem - all TVs need some kind of
 circuit to kick start the horizontal deflection until the auxiliary
 power outputs of the flyback are available.  Some Zeniths use a simple
 multivibrator for this - a couple of transistors.  Others power the
 horizontal osc. IC from a special line-derived voltage.  The multivibrator
 type are sometimes designed to fail if someone keeps turning the set on
 and off (like kids playing) since the power rating is inadequate.
<p>
 Test the transistors if it is that type with an ohmmeter.  If one is
 shorted, you have a problem.  The usual way a TV service person would
 test for startup problems is to inject a signal to the base of the HOT
 of about 15.75 kHz.  If the TV then starts and runs once this signal
 is removed, the diagnosis is confirmed.  This is risky - you can blow
 things up if not careful (including yourself).  See the section:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvbypsuc">Bypassing the Startup Circuit</a> for details.
</p></li></ol>
<p>
If you hear the high pitched whine of the deflection and/or feel some static
on the scree, confirm that the horizontal deflection and high voltage are
working by adjusting the SCREEN control (probably on the flyback).  If you can
get a raster then your problem is probably in the video or chroma
circuits, not the deflection or high voltage.

</p><h3><a name="tvredwphb">Reduced width picture and/or hum bars in picture and/or hum in sound</a></h3>

The most likely cause is a dried up main filter capacitor.  Once the
effective capacitance drops low enough, 120 Hz (or 100 Hz in countries with
50 Hz power) ripple will make its way into the regulated DC supply
(assuming full wave rectification).
<p>
Another likely cause of similar symptoms is a defective low voltage
regulator allowing excessive ripple.  The regulator IC could be bad
or filter capacitor following the IC could be dried up.
</p><p>
Either of these faults may cause:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>A pair of wiggles and/or hum bars in the picture which will float up
 the screen.  For NTSC where the power line is 60 Hz but the frame rate
 is 59.94 Hz, it will take about 8 seconds for each bar to pass a given
 point on the screen.  (On some sets, a half wave recitifier is used
 resulting in a single wiggle or hum bar).
<p>
</p></li><li>Hum in the sound.  This may or may not be noticeable with the volume
 turned down.
<p>
</p></li><li>Possible regulation problems resulting in HV or total shutdown or power
 cycling on and off.
</li></ol>
<p>
The best approach to testing the capacitors is to clip a good capacitor of
approximately the same uF rating and at least the same voltage rating across
the suspect capacitor (with the power off).  A capacitor meter can also
be used but the capacitor may need to be removed from the circuit.
</p><p>
Once the capacitors have been confirmed to be good, voltage measurements
on the regulator should be able to narrow down the problem to a bad IC
or other component.

</p><h3><a name="tvexcbpff">Excessive B+ from fixed regulator like STR30123/STR30130/STR30135</a></h3>

These are fixed regulators that do fail but the problem may be elsewhere.
<p>
If the B+ goes to high, the X-ray protection circuitry may kick in and shut
down the horizontal deflection.
</p><p>
If there is little or no load (horizontal deflection not running at all), all
bets are off as well - the resistor that is likely across input-output will
dominate and boost the voltage above the proper output for the regulator
chip.  Use a Variac to bring up the voltage to the TV.  If the deflection
does not start up at any voltage even with the B+ ramping up past its normal
value, the problem is probably in the horizontal deflection/startup circuitry,
not the regulator.
</p><p>
Some of these may go out of regulation if the output electrolytics are dried
up.  There might a a 10 uF 200 V or so electrolytic across the output to
ground.  Test it or substitute a known good one of about the same uF rating
and at least equal voltage rating.  If you can get the TV to work at reduced
voltage using a Variac (but possibly with hum bars in the picture and hum in
the audio), check the output capacitor.
</p><p>
Otherwise, it could be the regulator or one of its biasing components (sets
current to B input - the voltage at this input should be close to the
output voltage value).  Also check to be sure the input voltage is solid -
main filter capacitor is not dried up.

</p><h3><a name="tvpwrcyc">TV power cycling on and off</a></h3>

The power light may be flashing or if you are runing with a series
light bulb it may be cycling on and off continuously.  There may be
a chirping or clicking sound from inside the set.  (Note: using too small a
series light bulb load during testing for the size of the TV may also result
in this condition.)
<p>
If there is a low voltage regulator or separate switching supply, it
could be cycling on and off if the horizontal output, flyback, or
one of its secondary loads were defective.
</p><p>
Does this TV have a separate low voltage regulator and/or switching power
supply or is it all part of the flyback circuit?  For the following, I assume
it is all in one (most common).
</p><p>
Some simple things to try first:
</p><p>
Verify that the main filter capacitor is doing its job.  Excessive ripple
on the rectified line voltage bus can cause various forms of shutdown
behavior.  An easy test is to jumper across the capacitor with one of
at least equal voltage rating and similar capacitance (make connections
with power off!).
</p><p>
Use a Variac, if possible, to bring up the input voltage slowly and see if
the TV  works at any point without shutting down.  If it does, this could be
an indication of X-ray protection circuit kicking in, though this will
usually latch and keep the set shut off if excessive HV were detected.

</p><h3><a name="tvdttttfff">Dead TV with periodic tweet-tweet, flub-flub, or low-low voltage</a></h3>

A TV which appears to be dead except for a once a second or so tweet or flub
usually indicates an overload fault in the power supply or a short in one of
its load circuits.  In some cases, the low voltage (including B+) will just be
reduced to a fraction of their normal value as a result of an overload on one
of the outputs - usually the main B+.
<p>
This may be caused by a shorted rectifier in the power supply, flyback, or
even the yoke, but check the the loads first.  Wait a few minutes for the
filter caps to discharge (but stay away from the CRT HV connector as it may
retain a dangerous and painful charge for a long time), use an ohmmeter across
the various diodes in the power supply.  Using an ohmmeter on the rectifier
diodes, the resistance in at least one direction should be greater than 100
ohms.  If it is much less (like 0 or 5 ohms), then the diode is probably bad.
Unsolder and check again - it should test infinite (greater than 1M ohms) in
one direction.
</p><p>
Summary of possible causes:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Bad solder connections.
</li><li>Other shorted components like capacitors.
</li><li>Other problems in the power supply or its controller.
</li><li>Bad flyback.
</li><li>Short or excessive load on secondary supplies fed from flyback.

<h3><a name="tvbypsuc">Bypassing the Startup Circuit</a></h3>

Where the TV is dead and a startup problem is suspected, a TV service person
would test for startup problems by injecting a signal into the base of the HOT
of about 15.75 kHz.  If the TV then starts and runs once this signal is
removed, the diagnosis is confirmed.  This is risky - you can blow things up
if not careful (including yourself).  A 555 timer based circuit will work fine
as a signal source for this.
<p>
WARNING: be careful if you do this.  The HOT circuit may be line-connected
and it is possible to destroy the HOT and related components if this is not
done properly.  I once managed to kill not only the HOT but the chopper
transistor as well while working in this area.  An expensive lesson.
</p><p>
You can reduce the risk somewhat (to the TV at least) by using a series
light bulb load and/or running on reduced line voltage.  The most important
thing to avoid is putting in an excessively long drive pulse which will
result in the flyback transformer saturating, huge amounts of current,
and likely a dead HOT and possibly other parts if there is nothing to limit
the current.  For NTSC/PAL, it is fairly safe to assume that a 50 percent
duty cycle 15 to 16 kHz drive signal will not result in fireworks as long
as there aren't other problems (like a shorted flyback/LOPT).
</p><p>
If after a second or so, the TV fires up (not literally!) and stays happy
until it is turned off, a startup problem is almost certain.  It could be
the standby supply (if used) or a dedicated startup circuit that has failed.
</p><p>
But, don't push your luck - if the TV starts after a second or so of your
drive signal but doesn't continue to run when it is removed, don't be tempted
to leave your circuit connected - it could still be stressing other parts.
Find out why the normal horizontal drive is not being generated - possibly a
power supply or horizontal oscillator problem.
</p><p>
If nothing happens, either startup is not the problem or there are other
components that have failed preventing the HOT drive signal from having
any effect.

</p><h3><a name="tvshortc">Shorted Components</a></h3>

A failure of the horizontal output transistor or power supply switchmode
transistor will blow a fuse or fusable resistor.
<p>
Look for blown fuses and test for open fusable resistors in the power circuits.
If you find one, then test the HOT and/or switchmode transistor for shorts.
</p><p>
Other possibilities: rectifier diodes or main filter capacitor.
</p><p>
While you are at it, check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with an
insulated stick when the problem reoccurs - as these can cause parts to
fail.

</p><h3><a name="tvstartupp">Startup problems - nothing happens, click, or tick-tick-tick sound</a></h3>

TVs and monitors usually incorporate some kind of startup circuit to provide
drive to the horizontal output transistor (HOT) until the flyback power supply
is running.  Yes, TVs and monitors boot just like computers.
<p>
There are two typical kinds of symptoms: power on click but nothing else
happens or a tick-tick-tick sound indicating cycling of the low voltage
(line regulator) but lack of startup horizontal drive.
</p><p>
Check the voltage on the horizontal output transistor (HOT).  If no voltage
is present, there may be a blown fuse or open fusable resistor - and
probably a shorted HOT.
</p><p>
However, if the voltage is normal (or high) - usually 100-150 V, then
there is likely a problem with the startup circuit not providing initial
base drive to the HOT.
</p><p>
The startup circuits may take several forms:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Discrete multivibrator or other simple transistor circuit to provide
 base drive to the HOT.
<p>
</p></li><li>IC which is part of deflection chain powered off of a voltage divider
 or transformer.
<p>
</p></li><li>Other type of circuit which operates off of the line which provides
 some kind of drive to the HOT.
</li></ol>
<p>
The startup circuit may operate off of the standby power supply or
voltage derived from non-isolated input.  Be careful - of course, use
an isolation transformer whenever working on TVs and especially for power
supply problems.
</p><p>
Note that one common way of verifying that this is a startup problem is
to inject a 15 kHz signal directly into the HOT base or driver circuit
(just for a second or two).  If the TV then starts up and continues to run,
you know that it is a startup problem.  However, this is a risky procedure
for both you and the TV.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvbypsuc">Bypassing
the Startup Circuit</a>.
</p><p>
I have also seen startup circuits that were designed to fail.  Turning
the TV on and off multiple times would exceed the power ratings of the
components in the startup circuit.  Some Zenith models have this 'feature'.
</p><p>
When this situation exists, it could be that the circuit is not providing
the proper drive or that due to some other circuit condition, the drive
is not always sufficient to get the secondary supplies going to the point
that the normal circuits take over.
</p><p>
I would still check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with an
insulated stick when the problem reoccurs.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvtpawu">TV turns off after warming up</a></h3>

If you can turn it back on with the s momentary key or power button:
<p>
When it shuts off, do you need to push the power button once or twice
to get it back on?  Also, does anything else about the picture or sound
change as it warms up?
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>If once, then the controller is shutting the TV down either as a result of
 a (thermally induced) fault in the controller or it sensing some other
 problem.  Monitoring the voltage on the relay coil (assuming these
 is one) could help determine what is happening.  The controller thinks
 it is in charge.
<p>
</p></li><li>If twice, then the power supply is shutting down as the controller still
 thinks it is on and you are resetting it.  A couple of possibilities
 here would be low voltage or high voltage regulation error (excessive
 high voltage is sensed and causes shutdown to prevent dangerous X-ray
 emission).  A partially dried up main filter capacitor could also cause a
 shutdown but there might be other symptoms like hum bars in the picture just
 before this happened.  Clipping a good capacitor across the suspect (with
 power off!) would confirm or eliminate this possibility.
</li></ol>
<p>
If it uses a pull-knob (or other hard on/off switch), then this may be like
pulling the plug and would reset any abnormal condition.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvdpui">TV doesn't power up immediately</a></h3>

The TV may do nothing, cycle on and off for a while, power up and then
shutdown in an endless cycle - or at least for a while.  Then it comes
on and operates normally until it is turned off.
<p>
A couple of possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>The main filter capacitor or other filter capacitors in the low voltage
 power supply is dried up and this can cause all kinds of regulation
 problems.
<p>
</p></li><li>The power supply regulator is defective (or marginal) allowing excessive
 voltage on its output and then the X-ray protection circuitry shuts
 you down.
</li></ol>
<p>
If you can get access to a Variac, it would be worth bringing up the input
voltage slowly and seeing if there is some point at which it would stay on.
</p><p>
If there is, then if the picture has serious hum bars in it the main filter
cap could be bad.  If more or less a decent picture with minor hum bars then
it could be the regulator.

</p><h3><a name="tvoldtrwp">Old TV requires warmup period</a></h3>

So, what else is new?  In the old days, a TV was expected to take a few
minutes (at least) to warm up.  We are all spoiled today.  Of course, you
usually maintained a full time technician or engineer to fiddle with the
convergence adjustments!
<p>
A TV (from around 1983) needs at least 5 min. to warm up (lighting up the
screen and making sound if I give it a cold start.  Once warmed up, you
can it off and on again from the front panel and it will work immediately.
Another thing this TV has a sub-power switch in the rear.
</p><p>
1983 sounds a bit late, but sets in the late '70 during the transition from
tubes to all solid state chassis often had the 'sub-power' switch providing
some power to the filaments of the CRT and other tubes - usually in the
deflection and high voltage circuits since these would take a while to heat up
and stabilize.  The idea was to leave this switch on all the time (except when
going on vacation - it was sometimes labeled 'vacation') so that you would
have nearly instant warm up.  Supposedly, this led to an increased risk of
fire as well (see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvainsontv">About instant-on TVs</a>).
</p><p>
If it is a totally solid state chassis, then there is some component - probably
a capacitor in the power supply since it affects both picture and sound - that
is drifting with temperature and needs to be located with cold spray or a
heat gun.

</p><h3><a name="tvsdbpwb">TV shuts down with bright picture or when brightness is turned up</a></h3>

This is probably a protection circuit kicking in especially if turning power
off or pulling the plug is required to restore operation.
<p>
The detection circuit could be in the power supply or horizontal deflection
output circuit.  It may be defective or the current may be too high for some
other reason.  A couple of tests can be performed to confirm that it is due
to beam current:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Determine if behavior is similar when adjusting the user brightness control
 and the screen (G2) pot (on the flyback) or master brightness control.  If
 the TV quits at about the same brightness level, overcurrent protection is
 likely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Disconnect the filaments to the CRT (unsolder a pin on the CRT socket) and
 see if it still shuts down under the same conditions.  If it is overcurrent
 protection, shut down should now *not* take place since there is no beam
 current.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvrelaysp">Relays in the Power Circuitry of TVs</a></h3>

Where power on or power off is erratic or only seems to work part way (e.g.,
the picture goes off but not the sound), it may just be a sticking or dirty
relay.  Of course, general on/off problems could also be relay related
but could also be a lot of other things.
<p>
For erratic on/off problems, gently tapping on the relay when the problem
occurs will confirm that the relay is at fault - if the set then switches on
or off properly, it's almost certainly the relay and replacing it will fix
the problem.  But double check its solder connections to make sure it isn't
a simple bad connection to the relay or in its vicinity.
</p><p>
So what exactly is the purpose of such a power relay in a TV set?  Why doesn't
the power switch on the TV just apply power directly instead of through a
relay?
</p><p>
The usual reason for a relay instead of a knob switch is to permit a remote
control to turn power on and off.  If your TV does not have a remote, then
it is simply the same chassis minus 24 cents worth of circuitry to do the
remote function.  Isn't marketing wonderful?
</p><p>
The only unknown is the coil voltage.  It is probably  somewhere in
the 6 to 12 volt range.  You should be able to measure this on the coil
terminals in operation.  It will be a DC coil.
</p><p>
However, the relay controls the 125 VAC (or 220 VAC) which you should treat
with respect - it is a lot more dangerous than the 25kV+ on the CRT!
</p><p>
Almost certainly, the relay will have 4 connections - 2 for power and 2
for the coil.  If it is not marked then, it should be pretty easy to
locate the power connection.  One end will go to stuff near the AC line
and the other end will go to the rectifier or maybe a fusable resistor
or something like that.  These will likely be beefier than the coil
connections which will go between a transistor and GND or some low voltage,
or maybe directly into a big microcontroller chip.
</p><p>
However, a few sets use a latching relay - separate coils (sharing a common
connection) to 'set' and 'reset' the relay - like a flip flop.  In such a
case, the controller knows which state the TV is in (on or off) and sens the
appropriate pulse to the relay to change state.  And, there will be NO voltage
on the coils of a latching relay except when turning the set on or off.
</p><p>
Of course, the best thing would be to get the schematic.  Some big public
libraries carry the Sams' photofact series for TVs and VCRs.  If not, take
10 minutes and trace it.  You should be able to get far enough to determine
the relay connections.
</p><p>
Once you are sure of the AC connections - measure across them while it is
off and also while it is on.  While off, you should get 110 to 125 VAC.
While on and working - 0.  While on and not working either 110 to 125 VAC
if the relay is not pulling in or 0 if it is and the problem is elsewhere.
We can deal with the latter case if needed later on.  Note the even if the
relay contacts are not working, the problem could still be in the control
circuitry not providing the correct coil voltage/current, though not likely.
</p><p>
It may be expensive and/or difficult to obtain an exact replacement, but
these are pretty vanilla flavored as relays go.  Any good electronics
distributor should be able to supply a suitable electrical replacement
though you may need to be creative in mounting it.

</p><h3><a name="tvposistor">What is a posistor?</a></h3>

A posistor is a combination of a PTC (positive temperature coefficient)
resistor and another resistor-element to heat it up and keep it hot.
Sometimes, these will go by the name posister or thermistor.  The heater
is a disk shaped resistor across the power line and the themister
is a disk shaped device in series with the degauss coil.  They are in
clamped together to be in close contact thermally.  You can pry off the
lid and see for yourself.
<p>
The most common failure mode is for the part to short across the line.
</p><p>
Its function is to control degauss, so the only thing you lose when you
remove one of these is the degauss function on power-on.  When you turn
the TV or monitor on, the PTC resistor is cold and low resistance.  When
heated, it becomes very high resistance and turns off the degauss coil
but gradually - the current ramps down to zero rather than being abruptly
cut off..
</p><p>
Computer Component Source stocks a wide variety, I believe but it may be
cheaper to go direct to the manufacturer if they will sell you one.

</p><h3><a name="tvflamepr">Flameproof Resistors</a></h3>

Flameproof Resistor or Fusable Resistor are often designated by the
symbol 'FR'. They are basically the same.  The designation "Flameproof"
means that if they fail due to excessive current, there will be no
chance of, well, them going up in flames. :)  They will also have a
power rating and thus can act as a protective device, though a specific
circuit may not depend on a precise fuse rating, rather that the
resistor will open with massively excessive current.
<p>
You may see these in the switchmode power supplies used in TVs and monitors.
They will look like power resistors but will be colored blue or gray, or may
be rectangular ceramic blocks.  They should only be replaced with flameproof
resistors with identical ratings.  They serve a very important safety function.
</p><p>
These usually serve as fuses in addition to any other fuses that may be
present (and in addition to their function as a resistor, though this isn't
always needed).  Since your FR has blown, you probably have shorted
semiconductors that will need to be replaced as well.  I would check
all the transistors and diodes in the power supply with an ohmmeter.
You may find that the main switch mode transistor has decided to turn into
a blob of solder - dead short.  Check everything out even if you find one
bad part - many components can fail or cause other components to fail
if you don't locate them all.  Check resistors as well, even if they look ok.
</p><p>
Since they function as fuses, flameproof resistors should not be replaced
with higher wattage types unless specifically allowed by the manufacturer.
These would not blow at the same level of overload possibly resulting in
damage to other parts of the circuitry and increasing the risk of fire.
</p><p>
Then, with a load on the output of the power supply use a Variac to bring
up the voltage slowly and observe what happens.  At 50 VAC or less, the
switcher should kick in and produce some output though correct regulation
may not occur until 80 VAC or more.  The outputs voltages may even be
greater than spec'd with a small load before regulation is correct.

</p><h3><a name="tvwhcww">Width and height change with warmup</a></h3>

Since both width and height are affected, this points to something common
like the low voltage power supply.  If there are any indications of hum
bars, first check the main filter capacitor(s) or substitute a known
good one.  There might even be other symptoms like faint retrace lines
on at least part of the screen.
<p>
Start by monitoring the B+ to the flyback (feeding the HOT) to see if this
drifts at all.  If it does, then there is probably a low voltage regulator
problem - bad capacitor, resistor, or chip.  Use freeze spray to narrow
it down.  If this is solid, then there could be a high voltage drift but
this would be somewhat unusual without other symptoms (like arcing) since
the HV is nearly always tracks the low voltage supply.

</p><h3><a name="tvprbscr">Problems with SCR based regulators</a></h3>

Here are typical symptoms:
<p>
</p><blockquote>
"Sharp TV has a short blast of high voltage and sound then shuts down. All
 components in regulator area test good. I have two of these sets."
 Is there a good sharp tech out there thats seen this problem?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Mr. Caldwell (jcaldwel@iquest.net).)
</p><p>
There is a bulletin from Sharp on troubleshooting *any* SCR regulated TV, this
can easily be adapted to RCA, GE, Emerson and Panasonic sets that have similar 
circuits given a little thought but the technician.
</p><p>
You are going to need to figure part of this out as I no longer have the
schematics available. All this will do is allow you to rule out either the
regulator or the horizontal section. 
</p><p>
Don't plug this in until you've read the whole list.
</p><p>
Figure out how to bypass the turn on circuit from the microprocessor (unless
it's a manual one).  This is usually just jumpering the relay but sometimes
Sharp puts a horizontal Vcc turn on transistor that also must be jumpered.
</p><p>
Next jumper across the SCR anode to cathode.
</p><p>
Now using an *variable isolation transformer* turn the voltage on it down and
plug the set in.  Bring the voltage up slowly, if you can bring the AC up so
that the DC on the jumper across the SCR is within the regulated voltage you
should have a  picture and this rules out the horizontal section as the
culprit.
</p><p>
If the set shuts down prior to getting the DC up enough then you've got 
problems in the horizontal section. Either you have something wrong with the
high voltage transformer or the tuning caps or there is a problem with the
x-ray protect pick off voltage to the deflection IC. 
</p><p>
If it's the horizontal section you can set the AC at approx. 25v and look at 
the waveforms in the horizontal output section for defects like ringing.
</p><p>
I've never gotten a good troubleshooting technique down for the regulator
since it's an active circuit the waveforms and voltages are not stable when 
it's failed. A good diode, transistor and capacitor checker will help.
</p><p>
It would help to get the  service manual for that set, the training manual
for that chassis and the bulletin dealing with troubleshooting SCR regulators.
</p><p>
Also the training manual should have a good explanation of how this 
regulator works. In a nutshell the regulator is a switched mode circuit 
that uses a winding from the high voltage transformer to turn off the SCR.
The regulator is always turned off at the same time by a pulse from the 
high voltage transformer. Regulation is achieved by controlling when the 
SCR is allowed to turn on.

</p><h3><a name="tvsddpwcc">TV shuts down with dark picture or when changing channels</a></h3>

This may happen at any time or possibly after being on for awhile in which
something heats up and drifts out of spec.
<p>
The low voltage regulator may be letting the voltage rise excessively.  Then,
a dark picture or video muting during a channel change triggers the X-ray
or power supply overvoltage protection.
</p><p>
Monitor the output of the low voltage power supply B+ to see if it is stable
as the brightness/scene changes.

<h2>Deflection Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvdeflf">Deflection fundamentals</a></h3>

Note: the following is just a brief introduction.  For more detailed deflection
system theory of operation and sample circuits, see the document:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/deflfaq.htm">TV and Monitor Deflection Systems</a>.
<p>
The electron beams in the CRT need to be scanned horizontally and vertically
in a very precise manner to produce a raster - and a picture.
</p><p>
For NTSC and PAL, the horizontal scan rates are 15,734 and 15,625 Hz
respectively.
</p><p>
For NTSC and PAL, the vertical scan rates are 60 and 50 Hz (approximately)
respectively.
</p><p>
The deflection yoke includes sets of coils for horizontal and vertical
scanning oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other.  Additional
coils are needed to correct for pincushion and other geometric defects.
</p><p>
The deflection circuits must be synchronized and phase locked to the
incoming video signal.
</p><p>
Therefore, we have the following functions:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sync separator to obtain horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses.
<p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal oscillator which locks to horizontal sync pulses.
<p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal drive followed by horizontal output which feeds deflection
 yoke (and flyback for HV and other voltages),  Yoke requires a sawtooth
 current waveform for linear horizontal deflection.  Horizontal output
 in all but the smaller TVs is a large discrete power transistor, most
 often an NPN bipolar type.
<p>
</p></li><li>Vertical oscillator which locks to vertical sync pulses.  Yoke requires
 sawtooth waveform for linear vertical deflection.
<p>
</p></li><li>Vertical drive/output which feeds vertical deflection yoke.  Newer TVs
 use ICs for vertical drive and output.
<p>
</p></li><li>Various additional deflection signals to correct for the imperfections
 in the geometry of large angle deflection CRTs.  These may be fed into
 the normal deflection coils and/or there may be separate coils mounted
 on the neck of the CRT.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvavsr">About the vertical scan rate</a></h3>

Some people believe that the TV scan rate is locked to the local power line.
TVs never ever used the line frequency for vertical rate.  The vertical rate
is not even equal to line frequency, actually 59.94 Hz (NTSC).  It was set
originally to 60 Hz to minimize the visibility of interference between the
deflection and power transformer.  When NTSC added color, it changed to
59.94 Hz for highly technical reasons.  And, TVs no longer have power
transformers.
<p>
See <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/deflprob.gif">Symptoms of Some Common Deflection Problems</a> when
referring to the specific descriptions below.

</p><h3><a name="tvpsitd">Picture squeezed in then died</a></h3>

You were watching 'Knight Rider' reruns and all of a sudden, the picture
"squeezed in" slowly from the right hand side.  It "squeezed in" about 2 
inches or so when the entire picture went dead - has remained like this since.
Sound is fine, but no activity at all from the tube.  Has it died?  How
much time, effort, and expense to fix?
<p>
No, it's not dead, at least it certainly is not the picture tube.
</p><p>
Your set probably didn't like Knight Rider - at least that episode!
</p><p>
Seriously, how old is the set?  Is it a totally solid state chassis or
are there tubes in the deflection circuits?
</p><p>
Is there any indication of light on the screen?  Any indication of the 15735 Hz
horizontal running at all?  (You would normally hear the high pitch sound).
</p><p>
Newer TVs almost always derive voltages for the sound circuits from the
horizontal deflection but older hybrids may run the sound off of its own
power.
</p><p>
In any case, there is a problem in the horizontal deflection and you probably
have no high voltage as well assuming no light on the screen.
</p><p>
The fact that it squeezed in first indicates that a partial short or other
fault may have developed in the horizontal deflection circuits - possibly
the deflection yoke or flyback transformer.  It could also have been a bad
connection letting loose.  Once it failed completely, the horizontal output
transistor may have bought the farm or blown a fuse.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvnonl">TV non-linearity</a></h3>

Most modern TVs are nearly perfect with respect to linearity.  There are never
any user adjustments and there may not even be any internal adjustments.  See
the sections: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvhpssla">Horizontal position, size, and linearity
adjustment</a> and/or <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvvpsla">Vertical position, size, and
linearity adjustment</a>.
<p>
A sudden change in linearity or a TV that requires a warmup period before
linearity becomes acceptable may have a bad component - probably a capacitor
in the horizontal deflection circuits.  For the latter, try some cold spray
or a heatgun to see if you can locate the bad part.

</p><h3><a name="tvhdeflsd">Horizontal deflection shutting down</a></h3>

Confirm that the horizontal deflection is shutting down (along with the
high voltage since it is derived from horizontal deflection: listen
for the high pitched deflection whine, test for static on the screen,
see if the CRT filaments are lit, turn up the brightness and/or screen
control to see if you can get a raster) and then why:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Power is failing to the horizontal output transistor - this could be
 due to a low voltage power supply problem, bad connection, etc.
<p>
</p></li><li>Base drive to the horizontal output transistor is failing - could be a
 fault in the horizontal oscillator or bad connection.
<p>
</p></li><li>Problem with the flyback transformer or its secondary loads (flyback
 may provide other power voltages).
<p>
</p></li><li>X-ray protection is activating - either due to excess HV or due to a
  fault in the X-ray protection circuitry.
</li></ol>
<p>
If the problem comes and goes erratically it sounds like a bad connection,
especially if whacking has an effect.  If it comes and goes periodically,
then a component could be heating up and failing, then cooling, etc.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvwns">TV will not sync</a></h3>

There are a wide variety of causes for a TV that will not display a stable or
properly configured picture.  Among the symptoms are:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Lack of sync horizontal - drifts smoothly horizontally.  Depending on the
 difference between the video horizontal rate and the free-run frequency of
 the horizontal oscillator, the picture may be torn left or right (as shown
 in <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/deflprob.gif">Symptoms of Some Common Deflection Problems</a>
 or have multiple images superimposed horizontally.  The situation where the
 picture is neatly split horizontally (which is what you might expect) is a
 special case where the frequencies are virtually the same.  The key symptom
 common to all these is that there IS vertical lock (no blanking bar visible)
 AND there is no evidence that the deflection is even attempting to lock
 horizontally.
<p>
 This may mean that the horizontal sync signal is missing due to a sync
 separator problem or that there is some other fault in the sync processing
 circuitry.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Incorrect lock horizontal - a more-or-less stable torn picture.  This means
 that the sync signal is reaching the deflection system but that it is having
 problem locking to it.  The horizontal oscillator free-run frequency may be
 too far from what it is supposed to be (15,734 or 15,625 for NTSC and PAL,
 respectively).
<p>
</p></li><li>Lack of sync vertical - rolls smoothly vertically.  This may mean
 that the vertical sync signal is missing or the deflection system is
 ignoring it.
<p>
</p></li><li>Lock not stable vertical - jumps or vibrates vertically.  This may be a
 fault in the vertical sync circuitry.
<p>
</p></li><li>Multiple or repeated images horizontally or vertically.  Problems in sync
 processing circuitry.
<p>
Additional comments on some of these problems follow in the next few
sections.
</p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvhlockl">Horizontal lock lost</a></h3>

A TV which loses horizontal lock when changing channels, momentarily
losing the signal, or switching inputs may have a horizontal oscillator
that is way out of adjustment or has drifted in frequency due to aging
components.
<p>
Note that the characteristics of this are distinctly different than
for total loss of sync.  In the latter case, the picture will drift sideways
and/or up and down while with an off frequency oscillator, the torn up
picture will try at least to remain stationary.
</p><p>
This could be a capacitor or other similar part.  Or, the oscillator
frequency may just need to be tweaked (particularly with older sets).
There may be an internal horizontal frequency adjustment - either a pot
or a coil - which may need a slight tweak.  If a coil, use a plastic
alignment tool, not metal to avoid cracking the fragile core.
</p><p>
A schematic will be useful to locate the adjustment if any or to identify
possible defective parts.  Try a large public library for the Sams' Photofact
for this set.

</p><h3><a name="tviwwohb">Insufficient width (without hum bars)</a></h3>

If there are hum bars or wiggles in the picture and/or hum in the sound, see
the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvredwphb">Reduced width picture and/or hum bars in
picture and/or hum in sound</a>.
<p>
If both width and height are affected, the cause is likely something common:
low, low voltage power supply voltages or excessive high voltage (resulting
in a 'stiffer' beam).
</p><p>
(From: Jerry G. (jerryg@total.net).)
</p><p>
Lack of width is usually caused by defective power supply, low horizontal
drive to the yoke and flyback, defective circuits in the pincushioning
amplifier section, excessive high-voltage caused by defective voltage
regulation, and or excessive loading on the secondary side of the flyback.

</p><h3><a name="tvvlockl">Vertical lock lost</a></h3>

This indicates a picture that is correct but rolling vertically.
<p>
If the picture is rolling down the screen the frequency of the vertical
oscillator is incorrect - too high - and this may be the problem.  Generally,
the free run frequency of the vertical oscillator should be a little below
the video rate (of around 50 or 60 Hz depending on where you live).
</p><p>
If it is rolling continuously without jumping, then there is a loss of
sync from the sync separator or faulty components in the vertical oscillator
causing it to totally ignore the sync pulses.
</p><p>
If it is rolling up rapidly and not quite able to remain locked, the free
run frequency may be too low or there could be a fault in the sync circuits
resulting in an inadequate vertical pull-in range.
</p><p>
On older sets, there was actually a vertical hold (and possibly even a
separate vertical frequency) control.  On anything made in the last decade,
this is unlikely.  There may be Vertical Frequency and Vertical Pull-in
Range adjustments (and others) accessible via the service menu.  However,
if any of these ever change, it indicates a possible problem with the EEPROM
losing its memory as component drift is unlikely.
</p><p>
As with everything else, bad connections are possible as well.  You will need
a schematic and possibly setup info to go beyond this.

</p><h3><a name="tvvsquish">Vertical squashed</a></h3>

This is a vertical deflection problem - possibly a bad capacitor, bad
connection, flyback/pumpup diode, or other component.  None of these should
be very expensive (in a relative sort of way).
<p>
If the symptoms change - particularly if they become less severe - as the set
warms up, a dried up electrolytic capacitor is most likely.  If they get
worse, it could be a bad semiconductor.  Freeze spray or a heat gun may be
useful in identifying the defective component.
</p><p>
It is often easiest to substitute a good capacitor for each electrolytic in
the vertical output circuit.  Look for bad connections (particularly to the
deflection yoke), then consider replacing the vertical output IC or
transistor(s).
</p><p>
A defective deflection yoke is also possible or in rare cases, a bad yoke
damping resistor (e.g., 500 ohms, may be mounted on the yoke assembly itself).
</p><p>
Where the entire top half or botton half of the picture is squashed into
into the center (i.g., only half the picture shows), a missing power supply
voltage, defective vertical output IC, or a component associated with it
is likely bad.  A bad connection or blown fusable resistor may be the
cause of a missing power supply voltage.
</p><p>
The following are NOT possible: CRT, flyback (except possibly where it's
the source for a missing voltage but this is more likely just a bad solder
connection at a flyback pin), tuner (except for the famous
RCA/GE/Proscan or Sony models where the controller is at fault - see the
sections on these specific brands).  I am just trying to think of really
expensive parts that cannot possibly be at fault :-).
</p><p>
Note that some movies or laser karaoke discs are recorded in 'letterbox'
format which at first glance looks like a squashed vertical problem.  However,
the picture aspect ratio will be correct and turning up the brightness will
reveal a perfectly normal raster above and below the picture.

</p><h3><a name="tvpopco">Part of picture cut off</a></h3>

The following applies if the part of the picture is missing but not
otherwise squashed or distorted.  For example, 85% is missing but the
portion still visible is normal size.
<p>
Wow! That's an interesting one, more so than the typical run-of-the-mill
"my TV just up and died on me".  Or, "my pet orangutan just put a hole
in the CRT, what should I do"?
</p><p>
Since the size of the picture fragment is correct but 85% is missing,
my first thought would be to check waveforms going into the vertical
output stage.  The supply voltage is probably correct since that often
determines the size.  It almost sounds like the waveform rather than
being mostly on (active video) and off for the short blanking period
is somehow only on during the last part of the active video thus giving
you just the bottom of the picture. If there is a vertical output IC,
it may be defective or the blanking input to it may be corrupted.  The
problem may be as far back as the sync separator.  Then again who knows,
maybe wait for the schematics.

</p><h3><a name="tvsingvli"><single vertical="" line<="" a=""></single></a></h3><a name="tvsingvli">

CAUTION: To prevent damage to the CRT phosphors, immediately turn down the
brightness so the line is just barely visible.  If the user controls do not
have enough range, you will have to locate and adjust the master brightness or
screen/G2 pots.
<p>
Since you have high voltage, the horizontal deflection circuits are almost
certainly working (unless there is a separate high voltage power supply -
almost unheard of in modern TVs and very uncommon in all but the most
expensive monitors).
</p><p>
Check for bad solder connections between the main board and the deflection
yoke.  Could also be a bad horizontal coil in the yoke, linearity coil, etc.
There is not that much to go bad based on these symptoms assuming the high 
voltage and the horizontal deflection use the same flyback. It is almost
certainly not an IC or transistor that is bad.

</p></a><h3><a name="tvsingvli"></a><a name="tvsinghli">Single Horizontal Line</a></h3>

CAUTION: To prevent damage to the CRT phosphors, immediately turn down the
brightness so the line is just barely visible.  If the user controls do not
have enough range, you will have to locate and adjust the master brightness or
screen/G2 pots.
<p>
A single horizontal line means that you have lost vertical deflection.
High voltage is most likely fine since there is something on the screen.
</p><p>
This could be due to:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Dirty service switch contacts.  There is often a small switch located
 inside on the main board or perhaps accessible from the back.  This
 is used during setup to set the color background levels.  (On some sets,
 this is located on the CRT neck board and may be a jumper plug or other
 means of selecting service mode - not an actual switch.)
<p>
 When moved to the 'service' position, it kills vertical deflection and video
 to the CRT.  If the switch somehow changed position or got dirty or corroded
 contacts, you will have this symptom.  Flip the switch back and forth
 a couple of times.  If there is some change, then replace, clean, resolder,
 or even bypass it as appropriate.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Bad connection to deflection yoke or other parts in vertical output
 circuit.  Bad connections are common in TVs and monitors.  Check
 around the pins of large components like transformers, power transistors
 and resistors, or connectors for hairline cracks in the solder.  Reseat
 internal connectors. Check particularly around the connector to the
 deflection yoke on the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad vertical deflection IC or transistor. You will probably need
 the service manual for this and the following.  However, if the
 vertical deflection is done with an IC, the ECG Semiconductor
 Master Substitution guide may have its pinout which may be enough to
 test it with a scope.
<p>
</p></li><li>Other bad parts in vertical deflection circuit though there are not
 that many parts that would kill the deflection entirely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Loss of power to vertical deflection circuits.  Check for blown
 fusable resistors/fuses and bad connections.
<p>
</p></li><li>Loss of vertical oscillator or vertical drive signals.
</li></ol>
<p>
The most likely possibilities are in the deflection output stage or
bad connections to the yoke.

</p><h3><a name="tvkeyst">Keystone shaped picture</a></h3>

This means that the size of the picture is not constant from top to bottom
(width changes) or left to right (height changes).  Note that some slight
amount of keystoning is probably just within the manufacturing tolerance of
the deflection yoke and factory setup (geometry magnet placement, if any).  On
a TV, this is only noticeable with scenes having straight edges (e.g., video
games) in relationship to the CRT bezel.
<p>
However, a sudden increase (and it will usually be rather substantial in a
TV) may indicate a problem with the deflection yoke.
</p><p>
An open or short in a winding (or any associated components mounted on the yoke
assembly) will result in the beam being deflected less strongly on the side
where that winding is located.  Typical TV yokes have fewer individual windings
in parallel than high scan rate monitors so the effects of one such fault are
more dramatic.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdeflytst">Deflection yoke
testing</a>.
</p><p>
If the set has been dropped off a 20 story building, the yoke may have shifted
its position on the neck, of the CRT resulting in all sorts of geometry and
convergence problems (at the very least).

</p><h3><a name="tvlohsaw">Loss of Horizontal Sync (also applies to vertical) after Warmup</a></h3>

The problem lies either in the horizontal oscillator or in the sync system.
If it really is a problem with sync pulses not reaching the oscillator,
the picture will move around horizontally and can be brought to hold
momentarily with the hold control. If the picture breaks up into strips,
there is a problem in the horizontal oscillator. Rotate the hold control:
if the frequency is too far off, the picture will not settle into place
at any adjustment of the hold control. Look around the horizontal oscillator
circuit: all of the oscillator parts will be right there, or check on 
the horizontal oscillator module. Another horizontal problem can occur
if the set is an RCA made from around 1972-1980: these sets are designed
to slip very far off sync if the high voltage is too high, to protect
against radiation. Turning up the brightness will decrease the number
of bars if this system is in question, as the high voltage is decreasing.
In this case, check around the high-voltage regulation system on the 
deflection systems board. I've had 2 1970's RCA's with this problem.

<h3><a name="tvijjporb">Intermittent jumping or jittering of picture or other random behavior</a></h3>

This has all the classic symptoms of a loose connection internal to the
TV or monitor - probably where the deflection yoke plugs into the main PCB or
at the base of the flyback transformer.  TVs and monitors are notorious for
both poor quality soldering and bad connections near high wattage components
which just develop over time from temperature cycling.  The problem may happen
any time or more when cold or hot.
<p>
The following is not very scientific, but it works:  Have you tried whacking
the TV when this happened and did it have any effect?  If yes, this would
be further confirmation of loose connections.
</p><p>
What you need to do is examine the solder connections on the PCBs in the
monitor, particularly in the area of the deflection circuits and power supply.
Look for hairline cracks between the solder and the component pins - mostly
the fat pins of transformers, connectors, and high wattage resistors.  Any
that are found will need to be reflowed with a medium wattage (like 40W) or
temperature controlled soldering iron.
</p><p>
It could also be a component momentarily breaking down in the power supply
or deflection circuits.
</p><p>
One other possibility is that there is arcing or corona as a result of humid
weather.  This could trigger the power supply to shut down perhaps
with a squeak, but there would probably be additional symptoms including
possibly partial loss of brightness or focus before it shut down.  You may
also hear a sizzling sound accompanied by noise or snow in the picture,
static in the sounds, and/or a smell of ozone.

</p><h3><a name="tvhorkboeh">Horizontal output transistors keep blowing (or excessively hot)</a></h3>

Unfortunately, these sorts of problems are often difficult to definitively
diagnose and repair and will often involve expensive component swapping.
<p>
You have just replaced an obviously blown (shorted) horizontal output
transistor (HOT) and an hour (or a minute) later the same symptoms
appear.  Or, you notice that the new HOT is hotter than expected:
</p><p>
Would the next logical step be a new flyback (LOPT)?  Not necessarily.
</p><p>
If the set performed normally until it died, there are other possible
causes.  However, it could be the flyback failing under load or when it
warms up.  I would expect some warning though  - like the picture shrinks
for a few seconds before the poof.
</p><p>
Other possible causes:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Improper drive to horizontal output transistor (HOT).  A weak drive might
 cause the HOT to turn on or (more likely) shut off too slowly (greatly
 increasing heat dissipation.  Check driver and HOT base circuit components.
 Dried up capacitors, open resistors or chokes, bad connections, or a driver
 transformer with shorted windings or broken or loose core can all affect
 drive waveforms.
<p>
</p></li><li>Excessive voltage on HOT collector - check LV regulator (and line
 voltage if this is a field repair), if any.
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective safety capacitors or damper diode around HOT.  (Though
 this usually results in instant destruction with little heating).
<p>
</p></li><li>New transistor not mounted properly to heat sink - probably needs mica
 washer and heat sink compound.
<p>
</p></li><li>Replacement transistor not correct or inferior cross reference.
 Sometimes, the horizontal deflection is designed based on the quirks
 of a particular transistor.  Substitutes may not work reliably.
<p>
</p></li><li>CRT shorting internally.  If this happens only once in two weeks, it may
 be diffuclt to track down :-(.
</li></ol>
<p>
The HOT should not run hot if properly mounted to the heat sink (using
heatsink compound).  It should not be too hot to touch (CAREFUL - don't
touch with power on - it is at over a hundred volts with nasty multihundred
volt spikes and line connected - discharge power supply filter caps first
after unplugging).  If it is scorching hot after a few minutes, then you
need to check the other possibilities.
</p><p>
It is also possible that a defective flyback - perhaps one shorted turn - would
not cause an immediate failure and only affect the picture slightly.  This
would be unusual, however.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtofly">Testing of
flyback (LOPT) transformers</a>.
</p><p>
Note that running the set with a series light bulb may allow the HOT
to survive long enough for you to gather some of the information needed
to identify the bad component.

</p><h3><a name="tvhotbari">Horizontal output transistors blowing at random intervals</a></h3>

The HOT may last a few months or years but then blow again.
<p>
These are among the hardest problems to locate. It could even be some peculiar
combination of user cockpit error - customer abuse - that you will never
identify.  Yes, this should not happen with a properly designed TV though
newer horizontal processor chips are quite smart about preventing HOT killing
signals from reaching the horizontal driver.
</p><p>
However, a combination of channel changing, loss of sync when switching
video sources, and frequent power cycles, could test the TV in ways never
dreamed of by the designers.  It may take only one scan line that is too
long to blow the HOT.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the cause may be along the lines of those listed in the
section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvhorkboeh">Horizontal output transistors keep blowing
(or excessively hot)</a> and just not as obvious - blowing in a few days
or weeks instead of a few seconds but in this case, the HOT will likely be
running very hot even after only a few minutes.
</p><p>
Another possible cause for random failures of the HOT are bad solder
connections in the vicinity of the flyback and HOT (very common due to the
large hot high power components) as well as the horizontal driver and even
possibly the sync and horizontal oscillator circuits, power supply, or
elsewhere.

</p><h3><a name="tvvfold">Vertical foldover</a></h3>

The picture is squashed vertically and a part of it may be flipped over and
distorted.
<p>
This usually indicates a fault in the vertical output circuit.  If it uses
an IC for this, then the chip could be bad.  It could also be a bad capacitor
or other component in this circuit.  It is probably caused by a fault in 
the flyback portion of the vertical deflection circuit - a charge pump that
generates a high voltage spike to return the beam to the top of the screen.
</p><p>
Test components in the vertical output stage or substitute for good ones.

</p><h3><a name="tvcovertp">Comments on vertical problems</a></h3>

(From: Bert Christensen (bert.christensen@rose.com).)
<p>
As a general rule, vertical faults can be divided into two types: ones that
cause geometric distortion (a circle will not be round) and those that simply
black out a portion of the screen. The former are faults in the vertical
oscillator, drive, or output stages. The latter are blanking faults. Blanking
faults are almost always caused by electrolytic capacitors changing value and
thereby changing the timing of the pulses which blank the screen during
vertical retrace. In other words, the pulses are turning off the video signals
at the wrong time.
</p><p>
The most common true vertical fault is geometric distortion and a foldover of
white lines at the top of the screen. This is almost always caused by the
electrolytic capacitor on or near the collector of the vertical output
transistor or part of the IC which has the supply voltage (B+) on it. In the
old tube days, the general rule was that bottom distortion was in the cathode
of the output tube and distortion at the top was caused by a fault in the
drive circuit.

</p><h3><a name="tvjagged">Jagged or uneven vertical sweep</a></h3>

(From: Matthias Meerwein (Matthias.Meerwein@rt.bosch.de).)
<p>
I recently fixed two CRT display devices that both developed a very similar
problem: The vertical deflection was severely "jagged" with uneven line
spacing and partial vertical foldover.  One patient was a nameless el-cheapo
28-inch TV (1988 made), the other one a 14 inch ADI SVGA monitor (1991
vintage).
</p><p>
My first suspicions were bad contacts on the PCB or yoke connectors or
isolation / connectivity problems inside the yoke.  However, as the picture
didn't change with warmup or tapping, those causes could be ruled out.
Examining the vertical deflection waveform with the scope showed the problem
being a parasitic high frequency oscillation around the vertical output IC.
On the TV, the oscillation extended over the entire scan period, while the
monitor exhibited the problem only near the vertical current zero cross.
</p><p>
In both cases I found the capacitor of the RC damping network on the amp
output to be at fault.  Replacing it fixed the problem in both sets.  This is
not the well-known dried-up-electrolytic problem described in the FAQ.  The
culprits were mylar caps (.1 and .47 uF) looking completely unsuspicious.
They were probably a bit underrated voltage-wise (40 volts) so I replaced them
with 100 volts rated ones.  The 2.2 ohms resistor in series with the cap was
fine in both cases.

</p><h3><a name="tvewpp">Excessive width/pincushioning problems</a></h3>

This would mean that the left and right sides of the picture are 'bowed' and
the screen looks something like the diagram below (or the opposite - barrel
distortion).
<p>
However, the obvious symptoms may just be excess width as the curved sides may
be cut off by the CRT bezel.

==============================================
</pre>
<p>
In particular, this sounds like a pincushion problem - to correct for
pincushion, a signal from the vertical deflection that looks something
like a rectified sinewave is used to modify width based on vertical position.
There is usually a control to adjust the magnitude of this signal and also
often, its phase.  It would seem that this circuit has ceased to function.
</p><p>
If you have the schematics, check them for 'pincushion' adjustments and
check signals and voltages.  If not, try to find the 'pincushion' magnitude
and phase adjustments and look for bad parts or bad connections in in the
general area.  Even if there are no adjustment pots, there may still be
pincushion correction circuitry.
</p><p>
If the internal controls have absolutely no effect, then the circuit
is faulty.  With modern digital setup adjustments, then it is even tougher
to diagnose since these control a D/A somewhere linked via a microprocessor.
</p><p>
Pincushion adjustment adds a signal to the horizontal deflection
to compensate for the geometry of the CRT/deflection yoke.  If you have
knobs, then tracing the circuitry may be possible.  With luck, you have
a bad part that can be identified with an ohmmeter - shorted or open.
For example, if the pincushion correction driver transistor is shorted,
it will have no effect and the picture will be too wide and distorted as
shown above.
</p><p>
However, without a schematic even this will be difficult.  If the adjustments
are digital this is especially difficult to diagnose since you don't even
have any idea of where the circuitry would be located.
</p><p>
Faulty capacitors in the horizontal deflection power supplies often cause
a similar set of symptoms.

</p><h3><a name="tvdeflytst">Deflection yoke testing</a></h3>

A faulty deflection yoke can affect the geometry (size and shape) of the
raster, result in insufficient high voltage and/or other auxiliary power
problems, and blow various components in the low voltage power supply or
elsewhere.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A simple test to determine if the yoke is at fault for a major geometry
 problem (e.g., a keystone shaped picture) is to interchange the connections
 to the yoke for the axis that is not affected (i.e., the vertical coils if
 the width is varying from top to bottom).  If the raster/picture flips
 (indicating that you swapped the proper connections) but the shape of the
 raster remains the same - the geometry is unchanged, the problem is almost
 certainly in the deflection yoke.
<p>
</p></li><li>Where high voltage (and other flyback derived voltages) are reduced and
 other problems have been ruled out, unplugging the deflection yoke (assuming
 no interlock) may reveal whether it is likely at fault.  If this results in
 high voltage and a relatively clean deflection waveform or returns the power
 supply or deflection chip load to something reasonable, a defective yoke is
 quite possible.
<p>
 CAUTION: powering a TV or monitor with a disconnected yoke must be done with
 care for several reasons:
</p><p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>The CRT electron beam(s) will not be deflected.  If it turns out that the
  yoke is the problem, this may result in a very bright spot in the center
  of the screen (which will turn into a very dark permanent spot quite
  quickly) :-(.  Disconnecting only the winding that is suspect is better.
  Then, the other direction will still scan resulting in a very bright line
  instead of a super bright spot.  In any case, make sure the brightness is
  turned all the way down (using the screen/G2 control on the flyback if
  necessary).  Keep an eye on the front of the screen ready to kill power at
  the first sign of a spot or line.  Disconnecting the CRT heater as an
  added precaution would be even better unless you need to determine if
  there is a beam.
<p>
 </p></li><li>Removing the yoke (which is effectively in parallel with the flyback)
  increases the inductance and the peak flyback voltage on the HOT.  In the
  extreme, this may blow the HOT if run at full line voltage/normal B+.  It
  is better to perform these tests using a Variac at reduced line voltage if
  possible.
<p>
 </p></li><li>The deflection system will be detuned since the yoke inductance plays a
  very significant role in setting the resonance point in most designs.
  Don't expect to see totally normal behavior with respect to high voltage.
  However, it should be much better than with the faulty yoke.
 </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>If possible, compare all measurements with a known good identical deflection
 yoke.  Of course, if you have one, swapping is the fastest surest test of
 all!  In many cases, even a not quite identical yoke will be close enough to
 provide useful information for testing.  However, it must be from a similar
 piece of equipment with similar specifications - size and scan range.  Don't
 expect a color TV yoke to work in a high performance SVGA monitor!
<p>
 Note: the substitute yoke doesn't have to be mounted on the CRT which would
 disturb purity and convergence adjustments but see the caution above about
 drilling holes in the CRT face plate!
</p></li></ul>
<p>
The deflection yoke consists of the horizontal coils and vertical coils (wound
on a ferrite core), and mounting structure.  Little magnets or rubber/ferrite
strips may be glued in strategic locations.  DO NOT disturb them!  In rare
instances, there may be additional coils or other components mounted on the
same assembly.  The following deals only with the actual deflection coils
themselves - the other components (if any) can be tested in a similar manner.
</p><p>
Where the test procedure below requires removal of the yoke, see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrryoke">Removing and replacing the deflection yoke</a> first.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Horizontal - the horizontal section consists of an even number of windings
 hooked up in parallel/interleaved with half of the windings on each of the
 two ferrite core pieces.
<p>
 The horizontal windings will be oriented with the coil's axis vertical and
 mounted on the inside of the yoke (against the CRT neck/funnel).  It may be
 wound with thicker wire than that used for the vertical windings.
</p><p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>Resistance check - This may be possible without removing the yoke from
  the CRT if the terminal block is accessible.  Disconnect the individual
  windings from each other and determine if the resistances are nearly
  equal.  Check for shorts between windings and between the horizontal and
  vertical windings as well.
<p>
  Typical resistance of the intact windings (at the yoke connector assuming
  no other components): TV or NTSC/PAL monitor - a few ohms (3 ohms typical),
  SVGA monitor - less than an ohm (.5 ohms typical).
</p><p>
 </p></li><li>Inspection - Look for charring or other evidence of insulation breakdown
  due to arcing or overheating.  For the horizontal windings, this will
  require removing the yoke from the CRT since little if any of the windings
  are visible from the outside.  However, even then, most of the windings
  are hidden under layers of wire or behind the ferrite core.
<p>
 </p></li><li>Ring test.  See the document "Testing of Flyback (LOPT) Transformers".
  This deals with flyback transformers but the principles are the same.
  Disconnecting the windings may help isolate the location of a fault.
  However, for windings wound on the same core, the inductive coupling
  will result in a short anywhere on that core reducing the Q.
 </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>Vertical - The vertical section is usually manufactured as a pair of windings
 wired in parallel (or maybe in series) though for high vertical scan rate
 monitors, multiple parallel/interleaved windings are also possible.
<p>
 The vertical windings will be oriented with the coil's axis horizontal and
 wound on the outside of the yoke.  The wire used for the vertical winding
 may be thinner than that used for the horizontal windings.
</p><p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>Resistance check - This may be possible without removing the yoke from
  the CRT if the terminal block is accessible.  Disconnect the individual
  windings from each other and determine if the resistances are nearly
  equal.  Check for shorts between windings and between the horizontal
  and vertical windings as well.
<p>
  Typical resistance of the intact windings (at the yoke connector assuming
  no other components): TV or NTSC/PAL monitor - more than 10 ohms (15 ohms
  typical), SVGA monitor - at least a few ohms (5 ohms typical).
</p><p>
 </p></li><li>Inspection - Look for charring or other evidence of insulation breakdown
  due to arcing or overheating.  The accessible portions of the vertical
  windings are mostly visible without removing the yoke from the CRT.
  However, most of the windings are hidden under layers of wire or behind
  the ferrite core.
<p>
 </p></li><li>Ring test - Since the vertical windings have significant resistance and
  very low Q, a ring test may be of limited value.
 </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvdeflyrep">Deflection yoke repair</a></h3>

So you found a big black charred area in/on one of the yoke windings.  What
can be done?  Is it possible to repair it?  What about using it for testing
to confirm that there are no other problems before ordering a new yoke?
<p>
If the damage is minor - only a few wires are involved, it may be possible to
separate them from each other and the rest of the winding, thoroughly clean
the area, and then insulate the wires with high temperature varnish.  Then,
check the resistances of each of the parallel/interleaved windings to make
sure that you caught all the damage.
</p><p>
Simple plastic electrical tape can probably be used for as insulation for
testing purposes - it has worked for me - but would not likely survive very
long as a permanent repair due to the possible high temperatures involved.
A new yoke will almost certainly be needed.

</p><h3><a name="tvtofly">Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers</a></h3>

How and why do flyback transformers fail?
<p>
Flybacks fail in several ways:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Overheating leading to cracks in the plastic and external arcing.  These
 can often be fixed by cleaning and coating with multiple layers of high
 voltage sealer, corona dope, or even plastic electrical tape (as a 
 temporary repair in a pinch).
<p>
</p></li><li>Cracked or otherwise damaged core will effect the flyback characteristics
 to the point where it may not work correctly or even blow the horizontal
 output transistor.
<p>
</p></li><li>Internal shorts in the FOCUS/SCREEN divider network, if present.  One sign
 of this may be arcover of the FOCUS or SCREEN sparkgaps on the PCB on the
 neck of the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Internal short circuits in the windings.
<p>
</p></li><li>Open windings.
</li></ol>
<p>
More than one of these may apply in any given case.
</p><p>
First, perform a careful visual inspection with power off.  Look for cracks,
bulging or melted plastic, and discoloration,  Look for bad solder connections
at the pins of the flyback as well.  If the TV or monitor can be powered
safely, check for arcing or corona around the flyback and in its vicinity,
</p><p>
Next, perform ohmmeter tests for obvious short circuits between windings,
much reduced winding resistances, and open windings.
</p><p>
For the low voltage windings, service manuals may provide the expected
DC resistance (Sams' PhotoFact, for example).  Sometimes, this will change
enough to be detected - if you have an ohmmeter with a low enough scale.
These are usually a fraction of an ohm.  It is difficult or impossible to
measure the DC resistance of the HV winding since the rectifiers are usually
built in.  The value is not published either.
</p><p>
Caution: make sure you have the TV or monitor unplugged and confirm that
the main filter capacitor is discharged before touching anything!  If you
are going to remove or touch the CRT HV, focus, or screen wires, discharge
the HV first using a well insulated high value resistor (e.g., several
M ohms, 5 W) to the CRT ground strap (NOT signal ground.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsafdis">Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video
monitors</a>.
</p><p>
Partially short circuited windings (perhaps, just a couple of turns)
and sometimes shorts in the focus/screen divider will drastically lower
the Q and increase the load the flyback puts on its driving source with
no outputs connected.  Commercial flyback testers measure the Q by
monitoring the decay time of a resonant circuit formed by a capacitor and
a winding on the flyback under test after it is excited by a pulse
waveform.  It is possible to easily construct testers that perform a
well.  See the companion document <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/flytest.htm">Testing of Flyback
(LOPT) Transformers</a> for further information.

</p><h3><a name="tvflip">Horizontal or vertical flipped picture</a></h3>

The picture is flipped left-to-right or is upside-down or both.  This
cannot happen as a result of a failure.  For a CRT-based TV or monitor,
it almost certainly means that the wires to the horizontal or vertical
deflection yoke have been swapped to enable the picture to appear
correct when viewed via a mirror (horizontal only) or if the unit
were mounted base-up to a ceiling (both).  The remedy is simply to
swap the two wires to the relevant deflection yoke(s).  There may
even be obvious splices to guide you.  There is usually a connector
with 4 relatively fat wires that go to the deflection yoke on the
CRT neck (NOT the PCB attached to the tube base).  If you don't
have a schematic, trace these on the main PCB back to their origin.
The horizontal will originate somewhere in the vicinity of the flyback
transformer.  It may be possible to disengage the wires from
the connector shell and swap them there.  If not, cut, splice, and solder.
Adjustment of the appropriate centering controls may be needed.
<p>
For flat panel displays, it is even more unlikely this would happen as a
result of a hardware failure.  Most likely, there is a mode setting in the
one of the setup menus for the TV or monitor itself.  It could also be in
the receiver for the TV, or the driver or application software of the PC.
If the source is a video projector, the menu setting is likely there,
to select between front and rear projection (horizontal) or table or ceiling
mount (both).  So, don't bother to open up the flat panel TV or monitor.
The problem is not there! :)

<h2>High Voltage Power Supply Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvhvpsf">HV power supply fundamentals</a></h3>

Most, if not all, TVs derive the high voltage for the CRT second anode,
focus, and (sometimes) screen (G2) from the horizontal deflection system.
This technique was developed quite early in the history of commercial TV
and has stuck for a very simple reason - it is very cost effective.  A
side effect is that if the horizontal deflection fails and threatens to
burn a (vertical) line into the CRT phosphors, the high voltage dies as well.
<p>
Most TV high voltage supplies operate as follows:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Horizontal output transistor (HOT) turns on during scan.  Current increases
 linearly in primary of flyback transformer since it appears as an
 inductor.  Magnetic field also increases linearly.  Note: flyback is
 constructed with air gap in core.  This makes it behave more like an
 inductor as far as the primary drive is concerned.
<p>
</p></li><li>HOT shuts off at end of scan.  Current decreases rapidly.  Magnetic field
 collapses inductively coupling to secondary and generates HV pulse.
 Inductance and capacitance of flyback, snubber capacitors, and parasitic
 capacitance of circuitry and yoke form a resonant circuit.  Ideally,
 voltage waveform across HOT during flyback (retrace) period will be a
 single half cycle and is clamped by damper diode across HOT to prevent
 undershoot.
<p>
</p></li><li>Secondary of flyback is either a single large HV winding with HV rectifiers
 built in (most often) or an intermediate voltage winding and a voltage
 multiplier built in or a separate unit (see the section:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtripler">What is a tripler?</a>.  The output will be DC HV pulses.  
<p>
</p></li><li>The capacitance of the CRT envelope provides the needed filtering to
 adequately smooth the HV pulses into a DC voltage.
<p>
</p></li><li>A high resistance voltage divider provides the several kV focus voltage
 and sometimes the several hundred volt screen (G2) voltage as well.
 Often, the adjustments for these voltages are built into the flyback.
 Sometimes they are mounted separately.  The focus and screen are
 generally the top and bottom knobs, respectively.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvtripler">What is a tripler?</a></h3>

In some TVs, the flyback transformer only generates about 6-10 kV AC which
is then boosted by a diode-capacitor ladder to the 18-30 kV needed for modern
color CRTs.  The unit that does this is commonly called a tripler since it
multiplies the flyback output by about 3 times.  Some TVs use a quadrupler
instead.  However, many TVs generate the required HV directly with a winding
with the required number of turns inside the flyback transformer.
<p>
Triplers use a diode-capacitor ladder to multiply the 6-10 kV AC to 18-30 kV
DC.  Many triplers are separate units, roughly cubical, and are not repairable.
Some triplers are built in to the flyback - it is probably cheaper to
manufacture the HV diodes and capacitors than to wind a direct high voltage
secondary on the flyback core.  In either case, failure requires replacement 
of the entire unit.
</p><p>
For external multipliers, the terminals are typically marked:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>IN - from flyback (6-10 kV AC).
</li><li>OUT - HV to CRT (20-30 kV DC).
</li><li>F - focus to CRT (2-8 kV).
</li><li>CTL - focus pot (many megohm to ground).
</li><li>G, GND, or COM - ground.
</li></ul>
<p>
Symptoms of tripler failure are: lack of high voltage or insufficient high
voltage, arcing at focus protection spark gap, incorrect focus voltage, other
arcing, overload of HOT and/or flyback, or focus adjustment affecting
brightness (screen) setting or vice-versa.  Where there is overloading, if you
disconnect the tripler and everything else comes back to life (obviously,
there will be no HV or picture), then it is very likely bad.

</p><h3><a name="tvhvsdtxrp">High voltage shutdown due to X-ray protection circuits</a></h3>

A TV that runs for a while or starts to come on but then shuts down may
have a problem with the X-ray protection circuitry correctly or incorrectly
determining that the high voltage (HV) is too great (risking excessive
X-ray emission) and shutting everything down.
<p>
A side effect of activation of this circuitry is that resetting may require
pulling the plug or turning off the real (hard) power switch.
</p><p>
Was there anything else unusual about the picture lately that would indicate
an actual problem with the HV?  If this is the case, then there may be
some problem with the HV regulation.  If not, the shutdown circuit may
be overly sensitive or one of its components may be defective - a bad
connection of leaky cap (or zener).
</p><p>
If the horizontal frequency is not correct (probably low) due to a faulty
horizontal oscillator or sync circuit or bad horizontal hold control (should
one exist!), HV may increase and trigger shutdown.  Of course, the picture
won't be worth much either!
</p><p>
One symptom of excessive HV (but not required) is an overly bright picture
of reduced size.
</p><p>
The HV shutdown circuit usually monitors a winding off of the flyback
for voltage exceeding some reference and then sets a flip flop shutting
the horizontal drive off.
</p><p>
On some Sony models, a HV resistive divider performs this function and these
do fail - quite often.  The big red Hstat block is a common cause of immediate
or delayed shutdown on certain Sony monitors and TVs.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsonyhstat">Sony TVs/monitors and Hstat</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvelvsthvs">Excessive low voltage supply may trigger high voltage shutdown</a></h3>

(From: Ray Chandos (rchandos@ivc.edu).)
<p>
Modern television receivers and video monitors are all equipped with a
safety circuit to shut down the high voltage feeding the anode of the
picture tube if that high voltage becomes excessive.  (This is to prevent
dangerous x-rays emitted when electrons with too much energy strike the
metal shadow mask just inside the TV screen.)  Unfortunately, high voltage
shutdown problems can be very difficult to diagnose because, once shutdown
has occurred, the horizontal pulses used to generate the high voltage are
turned off, and with them the high voltage itself.
</p><p>
In many cases I have encountered, the high voltage is not excessive, but
the shutdown circuit itself has failed and falsely triggers.  A common
cause of this is failure of the circuitry that samples the high voltage and
feeds a portion back to the input of the shutdown circuit.  Typically, a
tap from the flyback transformer feeds a diode and a filter capacitor to
produce a sample DC voltage proportional to the high voltage.  As the high
voltage increases, so does this sample.  It is usually further reduced by a
voltage divider, then sent through a series zener diode to the "horizontal
shutdown" input of a video processor chip, so that, if the divided down
voltage exceeds the rating of the zener diode, the latter will conduct and
trigger the shutdown input, which then latches off the horizontal pulses.
Now if the bottom resistor in the voltage divider opens, or increases above
its nominal value (common for high value carbon resistors), the sampled
voltage will increase, possibly enough to falsely trip the shutdown input.
Check it with an ohmmeter.
</p><p>
Incidentally, if you don't have a schematic, you can still attempt to
diagnose and repair your shutdown problem.  Start with the video processor
IC, a huge chip that controls most of the TV functions.  Get the pinout
from this web site, the ECG semiconductor replacement guide, or data sheet
archives on the Internet.  Find the horizontal output and horizontal
shutdown pins, and attach oscilloscope probes to verify that you have a
shutdown problem.  If you do, you will see horizontal pulses for a brief
instant on power up, but suddenly disappearing as the shutdown input
voltage goes up and turns them off.  (This is a latching circuit, so the
shutdown voltage will normally stay high until the power is turned off.)
</p><p>
Now trace the shutdown signal voltage back through the voltage divider, the
filter capacitor, and the diode to the flyback winding.  Test out all these
parts as you go.
</p><p>
If the shutdown circuitry all seems OK, it may be doing its intended job of
detecting and disabling excessively high voltage.  Too much high voltage
often results when the lower voltage DC supply feeding the high voltage
supply circuitry somehow gets too high.  This voltage, often around +160
VDC, nowadays comes from the TV's main regulated power supply and is
applied to one end of the flyback transformer primary.  The other end
connects to the collector of the horizontal output (a large, high voltage
power transistor on a heat sink), the emitter of which connects to ground.
Horizontal drive pulses originating in the video processor circuit drive
the base terminal of this transistor, switching it on when the pulses are
high and thus supplying current to the flyback transformer primary.  The
secondary winding, having many more turns, steps up the +160 Volts applied
to the primary to 25 - 45 kV, which is rectified, filtered, and applied to
the anode of the picture tube.  Now if the +160 Volts increases, say to
+200 Volts, due to some malfunction in the main power supply regulation,
then the secondary voltage will also increase by the same percentage, and
trip the high voltage shutdown circuit.
</p><p>
Fortunately, although the high voltage quickly vanishes after shutdown,
preventing you from measuring it, the low voltage usually stays on.  You
can measure it (carefully) from the collector of the horizontal output
transistor to ground.  Of course, if you lack a schematic, you won't know
if this voltage is correct or not, so again trace it back from the flyback
transformer primary to the main TV power supply.  There you may find a
label printed on the printed circuit board telling you the normal voltage.
You can also get a clue by looking at the voltage rating of any filter
capacitor connected from this voltage line to ground.  For example, if the
filter capacitor is rated at 200 V and you are measuring 220 V, you know
you have a problem.  Sometimes the voltage will come from a linear voltage
regulator IC whose pinout and output voltage you can look up from the chip
number.  These linear regulators can short from input to output, raising
the output voltage and leading to the shutdown problem.
</p><p>
If the low voltage comes instead from a switching regulated supply and you
can't readily determine the normal output voltage, check for a bad filter
capacitor on the feedback winding.  Most such power supplies put out
several regulated voltages, derived from separate windings on the switching
supply transformer, then rectified and filtered, for use in various places
in the set.  Regulation of these voltages is accomplished by sampling the
output from a dedicated feedback winding, and then cranking up the
transistor switch if that voltage is too low, or cutting back the
transistor switch if the voltage is too high.  The idea is that, since all
of the output voltages come from the same transformer, with the output
voltage of each determined by the number of turns on its winding of the
transformer, if one voltage (from the feedback winding)is correct, then
they all will be correct.  Now if the filter capacitor on the feedback
winding opens, lowering the sensed DC voltage from that winding, what will
the voltage regulator circuit do?  Not realizing that the reduced feedback
is due to a bad filter capacitor, it simply cranks up the transistor switch
to get the voltage back up where it belongs.  But that raises all the other
output voltages as well, making them higher than they should be, including
the one powering the high voltage supply!  And that will trip the shutdown
circuit.
</p><p>
When replacing filter capacitors, be sure to use good ones rated for 105
(not 85) degrees C, and able to withstand the high frequency pulses they
are getting hammered by in these circuits.

</p><h3><a name="tvlonhv">Low or no high voltage</a></h3>

Most of these problems are due to faults in the horizontal deflection
system - shorted HOT, shorted windings or HV rectifiers in the flyback,
defective tripler, or other bad parts on the primary side of the flyback.
<p>
However, if you discover an inch layer of filth inside the TV, the HV
could simply be shorting out - clean it first.
</p><p>
In most cases, these sorts of faults will put an excessive load on the
horizontal output circuits so there may be excessive heating of the HOT
or other components.  You may hear an audible arcing or sizzling sound from
internal shorts in the flyback or tripler.  Either of these may bet hot,
crack, bulge, or exhibit visible damage if left on with the fault present.
</p><p>
Most modern TVs do not regulate HV directly but rather set it via
control of the low voltage power supply to the HOT (B+), by snubber
capacitors across the HOT, and the turns ratio of the flyback.  The
HV is directly related to the B+ so if this is low, the HV will be low
as well.  Faulty snubber capacitors will generally do the opposite - increase
the HV and the X-ray protection circuits may kick in.  However, low HV
is also a possibility.  The only way the turns ratio of the flyback can
change is from a short which will manifest its presence in other ways as
well - excessive heating and load on the horizontal output circuits.
</p><p>
While a shorted second anode connection to the CRT is theoretically
possible, this is quite unlikely (except, as noted, due to dirt).

</p><h3><a name="tvexcesshv">Excessive high voltage</a></h3>

Any significant increase in HV should cause the X-ray protection circuits
to kick in and either shut down the set or modify the deflection in such
a way as to render it harmless.
<p>
Symptoms include arcing/sparking of HV, smaller than normal picture, and
under certain scenarios, possible excessive brightness.
</p><p>
Causes of the HV being too high are:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Excess B+ voltage to the HOT.  The likely cause is to a low voltage
 regulator failure.
<p>
</p></li><li>Open snubber capacitors across the HOT.  These are under a lot of
 stress and are located near hot components so failure is possible.
<p>
</p></li><li>Incorrect excessively long scan drive to HOT caused by failure of
 horizontal oscillator/sync circuits.  However, other things like the
 HOT will probably blow up first.  The picture will definitely be
 messed up.
<p>
</p></li><li>Failure of HV regulator (tube sets and a few solid state sets - actual
 HV regulators are relatively uncommon today.)  This may result in an
 underscanned (smaller than normal) picture.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvscohvb">Snaps, crackles, and other HV breakdown</a></h3>

Various problems can result in occasional or sustained sparking or arcing
sounds from inside the monitor.  Note that a static electricity buildup
is common on the front of the screen.  It is harmless and there iss nothing
you can do about it anyhow.
<p>
The following may result in occasional or sustained sounds not commonly
associated with a properly working TV or monitor.  There may or may not be
flashes or blanking of the screen at the same time as the audible noise.
See the same-named sections that follow for details.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Arcing, sparking, or corona from CRT HV anode (red wire/suction cup).
</li><li>Arcing at CRT sparkgaps.
</li><li>Arcing from flyback or vicinity.
</li><li>Arcing due to bad connections to or disconnected CRT return.
</li><li>Flashovers inside the CRT.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvasocfcrt">Arcing, sparking, or corona from CRT HV anode (red wire/suction cup)</a></h3>

Symptoms could include a sizzling corona or more likely, an occasional
or rapid series of sharp snaps - possibly quite loud and quite visible - from
the anode connection (at the suction cup) on the CRT to the grounded coating
on the outside of the CRT or a chassis ground point (or any other conductor
nearby).  Corona is a high resistance leakage through the air without total
breakdown.  The snapping is caused by the sudden and nearly complete discharge
of the CRT anode capacitance through a low resistance ionized path similar to
lightning.
<p>
There are two likely causes:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Dirt, dust, grime, around and under the suction cup on the CRT are
 providing a discharge path.  This may be more severe in humid weather.
 Safely discharge the HV and then remove and thoroughly clean the HV
 suction cup and the area under it and on the CRT for several inches
 around the HV connection.  Make sure there are no loose wires or other
 possible places for the HV to discharge to in the vicinity.
<p>
</p></li><li>The high voltage has gone through the roof.  Usually, the X-ray protection
 circuitry should kick in but it can fail.  If cleaning does not help,
 this is a likely possibility.  See the sections: "High voltage shutdown
 due to X-ray protection circuits" and "Excessive high voltage".
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvaffpv">Arcing from flyback or vicinity</a></h3>

Arcing may be visible or audible and result in readily detectable levels
of ozone.  Note that very slight traces of ozone may not indicate anything
significant but if the TV smells like an office copier, there is probably
some discharge taking place.
<p>
WARNING: It is possible for arcing to develop as a result of excessive high
voltage.  Symptoms might be a smaller than normal excessively bright picture
but this may not be able to be confirmed until the flyback is repaired or
replaced.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvexcesshv">Excessive high voltage</a>.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the HV output, it will probably be a loud snapping sound (due to the
 capacitance of the CRT) with associated blue/white sparks up to an inch or
 more in length.  If the arc length is short enough, this may turn into a
 nearly continuous sizzling sound with yellow/orange arc and melting/burning
 plastic.
<p>
</p></li><li>Prior to the HV rectifier, it will likely be a continuous sizzle with
 orange/yellow/white arc and melting/burning plastic or circuit board
 material.
<p>
</p></li><li>Internal arcing in the flyback may be audible and eventually result in
 a bulging and/or cracked case (if some other component doesn't fail first
 as this would take some time to develop).
<p>
</p></li><li>A corona discharge without actual sparks or a visible well defined arc
 is also possible.  This may be visible in a totally dark room, possibly
 more likely when the humidity is high.  A thorough cleaning to remove all
 dust and grime may be all that is needed in this case.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the arc is coming from a specific point on the flyback - a crack or
 pinhole - this may be patched well enough to confirm that the rest of the
 TV is operational and a new flyback is worth the money.  Otherwise, there
 is no way of knowing if the arcing may have damaged other circuitry until
 a replacement flyback - possibly money wasted - arrives.
<p>
 To attempt a repair, scrape off any dirt or carbon that is present along the
 path of the arcing and its vicinity.  Then, clean the area thoroughly with
 alcohol and dry completely.  Otherwise, the dirt and carbon will just act as
 a good conductor and the arcing will continue under your repair!  Several
 layers of plastic electrical tape may be adequate for testing.  Multiple
 coats of high voltage sealer or non-corroding RTV silicone (if it smells like
 vinegar - acetic acid - as it cures, this may get in and affect the windings)
 would be better if the objective is an actual repair.  A thick layer of
 Epoxy may be even better and affected less by possible HV corona.  Either of
 these may prove to be a permanent fix although starting the search for a
 source for a new flyback would not hurt just in case.  The arc most likely
 did damage the insulation internally which may or may not be a problem in
 the future.
</p><p>
 Also see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdcpraf">Dave's complete procedure for
 repair of an arcing flyback</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>In some cases, the pinhole or crack is an indication of a more serious
 problem - overheating due to shorted windings in the flyback or excessive
 secondary load. 
<p>
</p></li><li>If the arc is from one of the sparkgaps around the CRT, the CRT socket,
 or the plastic 'alignment base' on the CRT itself, this could also be a
 flyback problem indicating internal shorts in the focus/screen network.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the arcing is inside the CRT, this could indicate a bad CRT or a problem
 with the flyback focus/screen network and no or inadequate sparkgap
 protection.
</li></ul>
<p>
Where repair seems possible, first, clean the areas around the arc thoroughly
and then try several layers of plastic electrical tape.  If the TV works
normally for say, an hour, then there is probably nothing else wrong and you
can try for a proper sealing job or hope that tape holds out (put a few more
layers on - each is good for about 8-10 kV theoretically).
</p><p>
However, replacement of the flyback really is the best alternative to minimize
risk of future problems.  This is the only option where there could be a
potential issue of liability should subsequent failure result in a fire.
</p><p>
Once I had a TV where the main problem was a cracked flyback arcing
but this took out one of the fusable resistors for the power supply to
the *vertical* output so the symptoms included a single horizontal line.
Don't ask me to explain - replacing that resistor and the flyback (the
flyback tested good, but this was for someone else) fixed the TV.
</p><p>
In another case, a pinhole developed in the flyback casing probably
due to poor plastic molding at the time of manufacture.  This resulted in
a most spectacular case of sparking to a nearby bracket.  A few layers of
electrical tape was all that was needed to affect a permanent repair.

</p><h3><a name="tvdcpraf">Dave's complete procedure for repair of an arcing flyback</a></h3>

(From: Dave Moore (penguin@datastar.net).
<p>
First I clean the afflicted area with Electromotive spray from Autozone. It's
for cleaning alternators.  On Z-line I remove the focus control and wash with
the alternator cleaner and a tooth brush until all dirt and carbon deposits
are removed. Then I take an xacto knife and carve out the carbonized hole
where the arcing broke through. Then take your soldering iron and close the
hole by melting adjacent plastic into it. (clean any solder off your iron with
solder-wick first). Then cut some plastic off of some other part off the
flyback where it wont be needed and use this to plastic weld (with your iron)
a hump of a patch into and over the arc hole. Smooth and seal with iron. Next
apply as thick a layer of silicone rubber as you can and let dry overnight.

</p><h3><a name="tvaasggdt">Arcing at spark gaps and gas discharge tubes on CRT neck board or elsewhere</a></h3>

These are protective devices intended to breakdown and divert excessive voltage
away from the CRT (usually).
<p>
This is rarely due to a defective sparkgap or gas discharge tube but rather is
a safety mechanism like a fuse designed to protect the internal electrodes of
the CRT if the focus or screen voltage should become excessive.  The sparkgap
breaks down first and prevents internal arcing in the CRT.  These sparkgaps
may be built into the CRT socket as well.
</p><p>
Arcing at a sparkgap or a glowing or flashing discharge tube may be accompanied
by total loss of picture or bad focus, brightness or focus fluctuations, or
any of a number of similar symptoms.  A common cause is a breakdown inside the
focus divider (usually part of the flyback or tripler) but could also be due to
excessive uncontrolled high voltage due to a failure of the B+ regulator or HOT
snubber capacitor, or (ironically) even a short inside the CRT.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Spark gaps may be actual two or three pin devices with seemingly no
 insides, part of the CRT socket, or printed on the circuit board itself.
<p>
</p></li><li>Gas discharge tubes look like small neon lamps (e.g., NE2) but could be
 filled with some other gas mixture to provide a controlled higher breakdown

<p>
Therefore, like a fuse, don't just replace or disable these devices, locate and
correct underlying problem.  The CRT makes an expensive fuse!

</p><h3><a name="tvadbcdcr">Arcing due to bad connections to or disconnected CRT return</a></h3>

The Aquadag coating on the outside of the CRT is the negative plate of the HV
filter capacitor.  If this is not solidly connected to the HV return, you will
have your 25 kV+ trying to go where it should not be.  There should be a wire
solidly attached to the CRT neck board or chassis.  Without this, voltage will
build up until it is able to take some other path - possibly resulting in
damage to sensitive solid state components in the process.  Therefore, is is
important to rectify the situation.
<p>
Warning: If you find this disconnected, don't just attach it anywhere.  You
may instantly kill ICs or other solid state components.  It must be connected
to the proper return point on the CRT neck board or chassis.

</p><h3><a name="tvflashover">Flashovers inside the CRT</a></h3>

Due to sharp edges on the electron gun electrodes, impurities, and other
manufacturing defects, there can be occasional arcing internal to the
CRT.  Properly designed HV, deflection, and power supply circuits can
deal with these without failing but not all monitors are designed well.
<p>
There is nothing you can do about flashovers assuming your HV is not
excessive (see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvexcesshv">Excessive high
voltage</a>.  If these persist and/or become more frequent, a new
CRT or new TV will be needed.

</p><h3><a name="tvozone">Ozone smell and/or smoke from TV</a></h3>

Smoking is just as bad for TVs as for people and usually more quickly
terminal.
<p>
White acrid smoke may indicate a failed electrolytic capacitor in the
power supply probably in conjunction with a shorted rectifier.  Needless to
say, pull the plug at once.
</p><p>
A visual inspection should be able to easily confirm the bad capacitor as it
will probably be bulging and have condensed residue nearby.  Check the
rectifier diodes or bridge rectifier with an ohmmeter.  Resistance across
any pair of leads should be more than a few ohms in at least one direction.
Remove from the circuit to confirm.  Both the faulty diode(s) and capacitor
should be replaced (though the capacitor may work well enough to test
with new diode(s).
</p><p>
If a visual inspection fails to identify the smoking part, you can probably
plug the set in for a few seconds until the source of the smoke is obvious
but be prepared to pull the plug in a real hurry.
</p><p>
If the smell/smoke is coming from the flyback, then it has probably gone
belly up.  You may be able to see a crack or bulge in the case.  While
the flyback will definitely need to be replaced, it is likely that nothing
else is wrong.  However, it might be prudent to use a Variac when performing
initial testing with the replacement just in case there is a secondary
short circuit or excess HV problem.

</p><h3><a name="tvxrayoem">X-ray and other EM emission from my TV or monitor?</a></h3>

X-ray radiation is produced when a high velocity electron beam strikes
a target containing heavy metals.  In a modern TVs and monitors, this can only
take place at the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphor screen of the CRT.
<p>
For X-rays, the amount of radiation (if any) will be proportional to
brightness.  The energy (determined by the CRT high voltage, called kVP
in the medical imaging field) is not affected.  This is one reason many
monitors and TVs are designed with brightness limiting circuits.
</p><p>
In any case, there will be virtually no X-ray emissions from the front of
the CRT as the glass is greater than an inch thick and probably contains
some lead for added shielding.  Also see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsibwaxray">Should I be worried about X-ray exposure while
servicing a TV or monitor?</a>.
</p><p>
Electromagnetic radiation (EM) is produced mostly from the deflection yoke
and to a lesser extent from some of the other magnetic components like
transformers and inductors.  Depending on monitor design (some are
specifically designed to reduce this), EM emissions can vary quite a bit.
Frequencies range from the 50/60 Hz of the power line or vertical scan rate
to several hundred kHz in the AM broadcast band.  The intensity and spectral
distribution will vary depending on horizontal and vertical scan rate.
</p><p>
A totally black screen will reduce X-ray emission to zero.  It will not
affect EM emissions significantly as most of this comes from the magnetic
parts, particularly the deflection yoke.
</p><p>
There is no measurable microwave, IR, or UV radiation.
</p><p>
I refuse to get into the discussion of what, if any, health problems result
from low level EM emissions.  There is simply not enough data.

</p><h3><a name="tvsibwaxray">Should I be worried about X-ray exposure while servicing a TV or monitor?</a></h3>

The only source of X-rays in a modern TV or monitor is from the CRT.  X-rays
are generated when a high velocity electron beam strikes a heavy metal target.
For anything you are likely to encounter, this can only happen in a vacuum -
thus inside the CRT.  The higher the voltage, the greater the velocity and
potential danger.  Really old TVs (prior to around 1975) may still have HV
rectifier and regulator tubes - other sources of X-rays.  However, modern TVs
and monitors implement these functions with solid state components.
<p>
The thick front CRT faceplate protects users adequately but there may be some
emission from the thinner sides.  At 25-30 kV (quite low as X-ray energies go)
X-rays will be stopped by almost any metal so what you have to worry about
is where there are no shields.
</p><p>
Other than lowering the brightness (or high voltage!), there isn't anything
you can do to reduce X-ray emission from the front of the monitor.  Any sort
of add-on screen (grounded or otherwise) unless it is made of thick leaded
glass, will have no significant effect on X-rays.  If you are still concerned,
sit farther away.
</p><p>
However, realistically, there is very little danger.  I would not worry about
exposure unless you plan to be sitting for hours on the sides, behind, or
under the TV or monitor - with a picture (there will be none if the screen is
black).
</p><p>
It is interesting that even those 1.5" Watchman and .5" camcorder viewfinder
CRTs have X-ray warning labels even though the high voltage used with these
isn't anywhere near high enough to be of any concern!

</p><h3><a name="tvmoradft">More on radiation from TVs and monitors</a></h3>

(From: Jerry Greenberg (jerryg50@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Your standard TV set or monitor should not exceed about 0.2 mR/Hr of
radiation from a distance of 5 cm from any part of the cabinet.  Most
TV monitor equipment is less than half of this amount.
</p><p>
The CRT has a coating on the inner wall of its glass envelope, and also
there is a metal shadow mask or aperture grill in the front.  There is
also a metal shroud around its parameter.
</p><p>
The type of emission from the CRT is known as soft X-Ray emission.
This is because it is low power, and is in the lower X-Ray region.
</p><p>
The X-Ray emission is strongest at the rear of the TV set because there
is some opened area where the electron gun is located. But, this is
very weak as well. The radiation from a TV or monitor is not being
focused to one point, and is also below the threshold level of being
dangerous.
</p><p>
The long term effect of the total radiation from normal operating TV
equipment is not fully known.    However,  the effect of X-Ray
radiation is accumulative over time if there are no breaks in between
the exposures.  As for standard focused X-Rays like the ones used in a
medical or security facility, these and most of their effects are well
known.
</p><p>
As for normal working TV equipment, when used normally, the total
radiation is less that what you would get when walking on the street.
There are many satellites beaming down signals, radio and TV broadcast
stations, communications systems, and then cell phones.
</p><p>
The X-Ray radiation in a TV set is emitted from the effect of the High
Voltage drive generating the electron beam.   If the High Voltage
exceeds the designed safety limit for the CRT, then there is concern
that the X-Ray radiation may have some effect on anyone that is in
close proximity to the CRT.  The amount of by which the high voltage
exceeds the design specfifications will determine the total X-Ray emission.
Since this emission is not focused into a fine area, its immediate danger
is also greatly reduced.
</p><p>
All  TV sets by law must have in their design some type of protection
to shut the TV down if there is excessive High Voltage,  excessive High
Voltage current drive, and a number of other safety criterias.
</p><p>
There is also the concern about electromagnetic radiation.  In fact all
radio frequencies are based on electromagnetic radiation (EMR).
</p><p>
There was a great concern about the low frequency EMR.  This would come
from the power supply, deflection amplifier stages, and then from the
deflection yoke and flyback transformer.   There different types of EMR
from TV sets.
</p><p>
Concerning TV's and monitors, this radiation worry comes up from time to
time.   If a woman is pregnant it would be wiser for her to not expose
the unborn baby by working close to a terminal or monitor.  This
nonexposure is a good policy to make sure that everyone is safe rather
than suffer any type of damage or health risks.
</p><p>
As for a safety concern for a mother to be,  or a small baby,  they can
be in front of a TV set but at least 5 to 7 feet away.  From this
distance there should not be any danger at all.
</p><p>
The above is from my personal observations and is very general. I have
also read various publications over the years that pertain to this
subject.
</p><p>
I have a personal concern about the radiation from TV sets and monitors
because I do an extensive amount of service on these.  I am also doing
a lot of picture tube changes in monitor equipment.  I am then exposed
for a few hours because I must do the purity and convergence setups of
these sets.   I have some days where I work 10 to 12 hours doing TV and
monitor service work.
</p><p>
If you want a TV monitor that will put out near zero X-Ray radiation,
and very low electromagnetic radiation, then go for one of the new LCD
flatscreen monitors.

</p><h3><a name="tvflyshot">Flyback shot by 4 year old with water pistol</a></h3>

Your 4 year old son shot the Sony in the flyback transformer. Smoke and sparks
everywhere.  Great aim!
<p>
Who says these FAQs cannot be funny?
</p><p>
Needless to say, unplug the set immediately.  Inspect around the target
area for obviously blown or damaged components.  Test fuses and fusable
resistors.  Repair burnt solder connections and circuit board traces.
Once the set is entirely dried out, power it up - preferably through a
series light bulb and/or Variac until you are sure nothing else will
let loose.  Look, listen, and smell for any unusual behavior.  If it
now works, then consider yourself lucky.  If not, there may be damage
to transistors, ICs, or other components.
</p><p>
(From: Richard Symonds (edison@nelson.planet.org.nz).)
</p><p>
We're seeing another 'hazard' these days, people cleaning their television
screens with window cleaner - no problem in the days of separate chassis but
with the entire circuit board jammed under the tube on most TVs these days
just a few drips and its all over.  Some have just corroded the switch banks
(had one recently just got into the A/V switch - when you walked around the
room the set changed to A/V and back by itself!) but a few have got around the
microprocessors and surface mount components and resulted in complete
write-offs.  I suppose the damage is the opposite of electroplating as the
microprocessors have constant voltage to them.  Never mind, they'll be a good
source of parts for future use.

</p><h3><a name="tvbloom">Blooming or breathing problems</a></h3>

There are several symptoms that are basically similar:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Blooming is defined as an expansion of the raster or horizontal sections of
 the raster with bright material.  For example, switching between dark and
 light picture causes the size of the picture to expand by 10%.  A slight
 change in size is unavoidable but if it is greater than 1 or 2 percent from
 a totally black image to a full white one, this is either an indication of a
 defective TV or one that is badly designed.  The cause is poor low or high
 voltage regulation.
<p>
 Check the B+ to the horizontal deflection.  This is usually well regulated.
 If it is varying in sympathy to the size changes, trace back to determine
 why the low voltage regulator is not doing its job.  The reason for the size
 change is that the high voltage is dropping and reducing the stiffness of
 the electron beam.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Expansion of the raster width in areas of bright imagery is an indication 
 of short term regulation problems.  The video drive may be interacting
 with the other power supplies.  Check for ripple - this would be
 at the vertical scan rate - in the various regulated power supplies.
 The cause may be a dried up electrolytic capacitor - once you locate the
 offending voltage, test or substitute capacitors in that supply.
</li></ul>
<p>
In both these cases, if this just started after some work was done to the TV,
the brightness limiter and/or video drive may simply be set so high that the
TV cannot supply enough current to the high voltage.  If the brightness
is acceptable with these turned down slightly and still have acceptable
brightness, then there may be nothing wrong.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Breathing is defined as a periodic change in the size of the raster which
 may be independent of what is displayed or its severity or frequency may
 be related to the brightness or darkness of the image.  This is another type
 of regulation problem and may be caused by bad electrolytic capacitors or
 other components in the low voltage power supplies.
<p>
 If the TV uses a switchmode power supply or low voltage regulator separate
 from the horizontal deflection, first check its output(s) for a variation in
 voltage at the breathing rate.  Test with a light bulb or resistor load to
 confirm that the problem is here and not the deflection or other subsystem
 of the TV.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>A condition with somewhat similar symptoms is bad focus - fuzzy picture -
 but only with bright (high beam current) scenes.  This could be just a matter
 of adjusting the focus control but may also indicate sub-optimal filament
 voltage due to bad connections or components in the filament circuit, or a
 tired worn CRT.  You won't get high beam current without some serious spot
 blooming (a fat beam because too much cathode area is used) and you will get
 cathode 'poisoning' after prolonged use.
<p>
 Visually inspect the neck of the CRT for the normal orange glow of the
 filaments and check for bad connections and bad parts.
</p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvefosvoc">Erratic focus or screen (G2) voltage and/or controls on flyback</a></h3>

Symptoms may include fluctuating focus or brightness.  In extreme cases,
the result may be a too bright or dark picture or other behavior caused
by breakdown in the Focus/Screen(G2) divider network.
<p>
Usually, this will require flyback replacement to repair reliably.  Sometimes,
the section with the controls can be snapped apart and cleaned but this is not
common.
</p><p>
First, just try rotating the screen (G2) control back and forth a few times.
This may clean up the contacts and eliminate the erratic behavior.  Possibly,
positioning it a bit to one side of the original location will help.  Then,
use the individual or other master background/bias adjustments to compensate
for the improper brightness.
</p><p>
If pressing in on the erratic control helps to stabilize the setting, you
might try adjusting it to the optimal position and then put a dab of hot-melt
glue (or Superglue if you can manage not to stick your fingers together) on
the shaft to hold it with a little more contact force.
</p><p>
If none of this helps, here is a 'well it's going in the dumpster anyhow'
procedure to try:
</p><p>
After discharging the CRT (so you don't get zapped) drill a tiny hole in
the plastic cover near the bad control.  Be careful you don't damage anything
inside - you just want access to the contacts of the controls.  Use a hand
drill with, say, a 1/16" bit.  Don't drill more than about 1/8" deep which
should enter the airspace.  Then spray some contact cleaner through the
hole and work the controls.  Wait sufficient time (say, 24 hours) for
everything to dry COMPLETELY and see if behavior changes (or it works at all).
</p><p>
This is a 'you have got to be kidding' type of repair so no guarantees :-).
</p><p>
If by some miracle it does work, fill the hole with a drop of RTV or just
put a couple of layers of electrical tape over it.

</p><h3><a name="tvfsdbs">Focus/Screen divider bypass surgery</a></h3>

This is kludge number 41256 but may be the difference between a bit more life
and the dumpster.
<p>
If the previous extreme measures don't help, then it may be possible to simply
substitute a good divider network externally.
</p><p>
Note that if there is evidence of internal breakdown in the divider of the
original flyback (hissing, cracks, overheating, bulging case, etc.), this will
not work unless you can disconnect it from its HV connection.
</p><p>
There are two issues:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is this a stable situation?  Even if you provide an external substitute,
 the parts inside the flyback may continue to deteriorate eventually
 resulting in other more total failure of the flyback or worse.
<p>
</p></li><li>If you provide an external focus/screen divider, it must be done is such a
 manner (including proper mounting and super insulation) such that it cannot
 be called into question should there be a fire where the monitor is even
 the slightest bit suspect.
</li></ol>
<p>
Various size external focus/screen divider networks can be purchased but
whether this is truly a cost effective solution is not obvious.
</p><p>
(From: Larry Sabo (sabo@storm.ca).)
</p><p>
I just ordered a 'bleeder resistor' from Data Display Ltd (Canadian sub of
CCS) to use as a cure for flybacks with flaky focus/screen pots. It contains
focus and screen pots, and costs Cdn$ 16.99, which is a lot less than a
complete flyback, that's for sure. I expect it will be compatible with quite a
wide range of flybacks.
</p><p>
I have used bleeder resistor assemblies from duff flybacks a couple of times
with good success. You connect the HV lead into the HV cap of the original
flyback, ground all pins of the sub flyback, and use the focus and screen
leads from the sub bleeder assembly in place of the originals.
</p><p>
Looks like hell but works fine. Mounting (and securing) the substitute is a
challenge given the limited space available. I only use this approach on what
would otherwise be uneconomical to repair, and always advise the owner or
customer of the cobbling job. It also enables you to verify whether it is
the flyback that needs replacement, versus the CRT.

</p><h3><a name="tvdoefosv">Decaying or erratic focus or screen (G2) voltages</a></h3>

The following applies to both CRT focus voltage (which should be a few kV)
and screen or G2 voltage (which should be several hundred V).
<p>
</p><blockquote>
"The screen voltage will come up to normal after sitting over night, 400 V or
 so. After approximately 5 minutes or slightly longer, I hear a slight arcing.
 From that point on, the screen voltage will wander anywhere from 75 V up to
 maybe 150 V. Adjustment of the screen control on the flyback has only a small
 effect and is not permanent. Removing the CRT pcb results in the screen
 voltage returning to normal."
</blockquote>
<p>
This is very likely a short between electrodes inside the CRT unless there
is something on the neck board that is breaking down as a result of some
connection to the CRT.  The flyback should largely not know the difference
with the socket plugged into the CRT.  However, on rare occasions, there is
contamination within the 'plastic alignment base' on the end of the CRT
neck.  (It is possible to *carefully* remove the plastic piece and clean
the CRT glass/pins.  Reinstall the plastic piece if it is still intact
or leave it off - just take care in replacing the CRT neck board.)
</p><p>
One possibility is that glue used to hold components down on some circuit
boards has deteriorated and turned conductive.  Check for tan to brown
stuff shorting traces on the CRT neck board.  If this is present on the
focus or screen traces or wires, it may just be your problem.  Scrape off
all of the old glue and then clean thoroughly.  Repair any damaged traces.
</p><p>
What happens to the HV?  A HV breakdown possibly inside the CRT would result
in all the voltages being dragged down.
</p><p>
What happens to the picture?
</p><p>
If you connect a charged HV capacitor (guessing a couple hundred volts,
a couple microfarads) between G2 and G1 or focus, you **will** know if
tapping the neck results in a momentary short!  I cannot predict whether
this will be a temporary cure or permanent killer.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrescuesc">Rescuing a shorted CRT</a>.
</p><p>
Here is another thing to try: put a 100 M ohm or so resistor between SCREEN
and the CRT socket.  This should not affect the behavior much until the
failure occurs.  Then, check the voltage on both sides with a high impedance
voltmeter (1000 M).  If the CRT is arcing, it will be much lower on the CRT 
side and will probably fluctuate.  You can play similar games with focus
voltage.

</p><h3><a name="tvdfwfcdb">Disconnecting flyback wire(s) from CRT driver board</a></h3>

In some cases, there may be one or more separate wires running to directly
to the CRT socket.  These are typically for focus which has a relatively
high voltage so better insulation is needed but there may be no obvious means
of removal should flyback replacement be needed.
<p>
One alternative is simply to cut the wire(s) in a location that is well away
from any place to short out, solder, and then do a  most excellent job of
insulating the splice.  If there is more than one wire, make sure to label
them first if they aren't color coded.
</p><p>
However, you may find that the cap on the CRT socket snaps off using a thin
knife blade or screwdriver.  The wire may be soldered or just pressed in place
in such a way that pulling it out is difficult or impossible without removing
the cover.  If there is more than one wire, label them before removal unless
the locations are clearly marked.  Sometimes the color is stamped on the
plastic but there may just be a designation like "A" and "B".
</p><p>
(From: Raymond Carlsen (rrcc@u.washington.edu).)
</p><p>
The last one I worked on puzzled me for a few moments. See if you can see a
space between the little cup (where the wire enters the socket) and the socket
itself.  Pry up on the cap with a knife and it should pop right off. The wire
is soldered to a pin under it. Don't apply heat for very long... you may melt
the socket. 

</p><h3><a name="tvfpsvdaw">Focus or screen voltage drifts after warmup only when CRT is connected</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I have a 3-5 yr old TV that loses screen voltage.  I believe that the problem
 is specific to the CRT or the flyback, either one is a guess I'd rather be
 sure of prior to ordering a part. 
<p>
 The screen voltage will come up to normal after sitting over night, 400 V or
 so. After approximately 5 minutes or slightly longer, I hear a slight arcing.

</p><p>
 I cannot find the source of the arcing, as it happens quickly and I have
 always been on the other side of the set when it happens. I have replaced
 the CRT socket, thinking the spark gap was arcing. I have checked the CRT
 for G1 and HK shorts on a sencore CRT checker, it checks good, but I am aware
 that since it is an intermittent problem, that the checker probably will not
 catch it."

<h2>Raster, Color, and Video Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvncbwp">No color - black and white picture</a></h3>

This means absolutely no color - equivalent to a black and white picture.
Not even a hint of color.
<p>
First, confirm that the source is actually in color - try another channel
or input device.
</p><p>
Next, check the settings of the color control - it may have accidentally
been turned down.  If your TV has some kind of automatic picture mode,
try turning if off and adjusting the color control.  Try adjusting fine
tuning if you have such a control and the problem is with a broadcast
or cable transmission.
</p><p>
At this point with a confirmed color signal source, there is a problem
with the chroma circuitry.
</p><p>
Note that to the average person, the obvious question becomes: is my color
picture tube bad?  The answer is a definitive NO.  It is virtually impossible
for a defective CRT to cause a total loss of color.  A defective CRT can
cause a lack of a primary color - R, G, or, B or a short between two colors
which will mess up the color but is not likely to result in a black and white
picture.
</p><p>
Some possibilities in no particular order:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Weak signal or defect in tuner/IF causing loss of signal strength.
<p>
</p></li><li>Coler killer set too high (internal control) if it has one.
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective part around the chroma chip/circuit.  Faulty color
 oscillator.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad connections in area of chroma chip/circuit.
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective chroma chip (don't suspect this first just because it
 is probably very expensive).
</li></ol>
<p>
A service manual or Sams', DMM, and scope will help greatly in attempting to 
troubleshoot this unless it is an obvious bad connection.  Try prodding
the main board around the chroma chip with an insulated tool to see if
you can make the color come and go.
</p><p>
I had one set where a $.02 resistor decided to open up causing just this
problem - perfect BW picture, no color.  Another had a coil with a broken wire.

</p><h3><a name="tvscbanb">Saturated color but almost no brightness</a></h3>

This means you have lost the luminance input to the chroma decoder or final
video chip.  A failure of the brightness limiter may result in similar
symptoms.
<p>
A few common causes are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check the service switch (if any).  Its contacts may be dirty and moving it
 back and forth a few times or using contact cleaner may be all that is
 needed.
<p>
</p></li><li>Check for open high value resistors around the chroma decoder IC.
<p>
</p></li><li>Check for open high value resistors in the brightness limiter circuit.
</li></ul>
<p>
With a scope and schematic (or even just a pinout for the chip), you should be
able to trace the luminance signal to see where it is getting lost.
</p><p>
This is also *not* a picture tube problem. :-)
</p><p>
(From: John Mehrtens (sarge@drag-net.com).)
</p><p>
I have had several TVs and monitors where the delay line in the luminance
circuitry has failed.  Usually it's made out of glass, and inherently is
fragile.  Sometimes whacking the monitor would make it come back, leading
to the thought of connectoritis or a cold solder joint -- where in fact it
was the delay line (long rectangular unit with two to four leads).
Replacing the delay line was the solution, but to check it first it'd be a
good idea to look for 'in' and 'out' on the line and short the pins.  The
picture may be shifted, colours may not line up, but it'll tell you that
it's the delay line if the picture comes back at all.  It's better than
looking at a saturated picture with no luminance! :)

</p><h3><a name="tvbchne">Brightness control has no effect</a></h3>

The following assumes that the picture is fine but the brightness is
fixed - probably at too high a level.  However, there could be several
interrelated problems if a common supply voltage were missing, for example.
<p>
If it is a knob, then it should be varying the control grid (G1) voltages
relative to the cathodes (K) of the CRT.  This is not likely to be a very
complex circuit.  If you do not have a schematic, I would start by tracing
from the control, check continuity and solder connections.  Check the
control itself for proper operation with an ohmmeter.  A power supply going
to one side of the control (negative probably) may be missing.  Tbe control
grid voltage will end up on the little board on the neck of the CRT - check
there as well for bad solder connections or open resistors.
</p><p>
If brightness is a digital control, then you will need a schematic unless
there is an obvious bad connection.

</p><h3><a name="tvoctwts">One color is too weak or too strong</a></h3>

If the problem is slight and/or has gradually gotten worse, this may just
require an adjustment of the color brightness/background/bias and/or color
gain/drive controls inside the TV.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvcbadj">Color balance adjustment</a>.
<p>
Note that if it is possible to obtain a good black and white picture with the
user color control set to its minimum, then this is not likely a problem with
one of the primary color channels (red, green, or blue) but with the chroma
decoding circuitry.  Or, perhaps, you are just watching MTV!
</p><p>
Even if it appears as though there is an excess, this may actually be a
reduction in one of the primary colors.  For example, a magenta tinge is
represents a reduction in the strength of the green signal.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Too high an intensity for one of the color channels will result in a tint of
 one of the primaries: red, green or blue.
<p>
</p></li><li>Too low an intensity for one of the color channels will result in a tint of
 the complement of one of the primaries: yellow, cyan, or magenta.
<p>
</p></li><li>Problems mainly in the shadows or dark areas of the picture usually represent
 a fault with brightness/bias/background.
<p>
</p></li><li>Problems mainly in the highlights or bright areas of the picture usually
 represent a fault with the gain/drive.
</li></ul>
<p>
A color that that is now suddenly brighter or darker than normal resulting in
incorrect color balance or a tint in the background could be due to a number
of causes:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Bad connections or bad component in video amplifier or on CRT neck board for
 that color.
<p>
</p></li><li>Fault in chroma decoder.
<p>
</p></li><li>Weak gun in CRT (reduced color).
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvpsychc">Psychodelic color</a></h3>

The means colors that are not normal and that adjustment of the user
controls is not able to correct it so that all colors of the picture
are properly displayed at the same time.  For example, you are unable
to get any yellows or blues in scenes that should have these colors..
<p>
Make sure the user color and tint controls have not been accidentally
turned while cleaning or purposedly misadjusted by small (or large) kids.
</p><p>
Perform the user setup described in the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvupadj">User
picture adjustment</a>.
</p><p>
Confirm that the source is not a weird color video - try another
channel or a tape.
</p><p>
Verify that this is not a missing color problem - one of the primary R, G,
or B, has disappeared.  If so, refer to the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvintmisc">Intermittent or missing colors</a>.
</p><p>
Once these have been eliminated, you are left with the
following possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Defective part around the chroma chip/circuit.  Misadjusted color
 oscillator.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad connections or short circuit in area of chroma chip/circuit.
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective chroma chip (don't suspect this first just because it
 is probably very expensive).
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad degauss circuit resulting in lack of degauss or abrupt termination
 of degauss current rather than smooth tail off.  The CRT is not being
 properly demagnetized and color purity is totally messed up.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad CRT - the shadow mask has been damaged and it is impossible to
 properly adjust purity across the screen.
</li></ol>
<p>
A service manual or Sams', DMM, and scope will help greatly in attempting to 
troubleshoot this unless it is an obvious bad connection.  For (1)-(3),
try prodding the main board around the chroma chip with an insulated tool
to see if you can restore normal color.  For (4) try manually degaussing
(see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT</a>.
If this clears up the colors until at least when it is power cycled, then a
degauss problem is likely.
</p><p>
Something as simple as a bad resistor or inductor can be the cause - don't
immediately suspect the most expensive and difficult to replace part.

</p><h3><a name="tvnpdpep">No picture/dark picture/erratic picture</a></h3>

If everything else works - there is sound and high voltage (static on the
screen) - but there is no picture (including no on-screen menus), this limits
the likely area of problems is the video output circuitry or CRT filament
connections.  Check to see if the CRT filaments are glowing.  If they are
not glowing, check for bad soldering on the CRT neck board and around
the flyback transformer.
<p>
Where the picture is erratic - coming and going entirely or changing brightness
suddenly,  with power off, remove the picture tube socket (carefully!) and
clean the pins with fine sandpaper and use contact cleaner on the socket.
This source of bad connections can result in a variety of erratic symptoms.
Check for bad solder connections on the CRT neck board.

</p><h3><a name="tvtmmqcs">TV and monitor manufacturing quality and cold solder joints</a></h3>

Any intermittent problems with monitors that cause random sudden changes in
the picture brightness, color, size, or position are often a result of bad
connections.  Strategically placed bad connections can also cause parts to
blow.  For example, a bad connection to the SCR anode in a phase controlled
power supply can result in all the current passing through the startup
resistor, blowing it as well as other components.  I had a TV like this - the
real problem was a bad solder joint at a pin on the flyback.  Thus, erratic
problems, especially where they are power or deflection related, should not be
ignored!
<p>
Bad solder joints are very common in TVs and monitors due both to poor quality
manufacturing as well as to deterioration of the solder bond after numerous
thermal cycles and components running at high temperature.  Without knowing
anything about the circuitry, it is usually possible to cure these problems
by locating all bad solder connections and cleaning and reseating internal
connectors.  The term 'cold solder joint' strictly refers to a solder
connection that was either not heated enough during manufacturing, was
cooled too quickly, or where part pins were moved before the solder had
a chance to solidify.  A similar situation can develop over time with
thermal cycling where parts are not properly fastened and are essentially
being held in by the solder alone.  Both situations are most common with
the pins of large components like transformers, power transistors and
power resistors, and large connectors.  The pins of the components have
a large thermal mass and may not get hot enough during manufacturing.  Also,
they are relatively massive and may flex the connection due to vibration
or thermal expansion and contraction.
</p><p>
To locate cold solder joints, use a strong light and magnifier and examine
the pins of large components for hairline cracks in the solder around the
pin.  Gently wiggle the component if possible (with the power off).  Any
detectable movement at the joint indicates a problem.  With the power on,
gently prod the circuit board and suspect components with an insulated
tool to see if the problem can be effected.
</p><p>
When in doubt, resolder any suspicious connections.  Some monitors may
use double sided circuit boards which do not have plated through holes.
In these cases, solder both top and bottom to be sure that the connections
are solid.  Use a large enough soldering iron to assure that your solder
connection is solid.  Put a bit of new solder with flux on every connection
you touch up even if there was plenty of solder there before.

</p><h3><a name="tvwctmlsp">Why can't TV manufacturers learn to solder properly?</a></h3>

I can think of several potential reasons - all solvable but at higher
manufacturing cost.
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Mass of large component leads (like shields) does not get adequately
 heated during manufacture leading to latent cold solder joints.  While
 they may look ok, the solder never actually 'wetted' the heavy pins
 and therefore did not form a good mechanical or electrical bond.
<p>
</p></li><li>Thermal cycles and differential thermal coefficients of circuit boards,
 traces, and solder.  While it is not easy to do anything about the
 material properties, using plated through-holes or a similar mechanical
 via would greatly increase the surface area of the joint and prevent
 the formation of cracks.
<p>
</p></li><li>Vibration.  This is also directly related to the single sided circuit
 boards without plated through-holes to strengthen the joints.
<p>
</p></li><li>Lack of adquate mechanical support (single sided circuit boards without
 plated through-holes (vias).
</li></ol>
<p>
I believe that the single most significantimprovement would come about
by using plated trhough-holes but this would add to the cost and apparently
the consumer is not willing to pay more for better quality and reliability!
Some designs have used rivlets - mechanical vias instead of plated ones.
While this is good in principle, the execution has often been flawed where
cold solder joints resulted between the rivlets and the circuit board traces
due to lack of adequate process control.
</p><p>
The Sony and RCA/GE tuner shield problem is interesting because this
could have been solved years ago at essentially no additional cost as
other manufacturers - and their own repair procedures - have proven.

</p><h3><a name="tvintmisc">Intermittent or missing colors</a></h3>

This is a catch-all for some of the most common TV and monitor problems.
<p>
Note that due to the additive color scheme used in all emissive color displays
like CRT or flat panel TV sets and video monitors, a single missing primary
color (red, green, or blue) will result in the following appearance (for a
white screen):
</p><p>
</p><pre>    Missing Color       Appearance
  ------------------------------------------------
       Red              Cyan (blue-green)
       Green            Magenta (reddish-purple)
       Blue             Yellow
</pre>
<p>
Which color is affected may be even more obvious if the set has a color
on-screen display for which you recall the proper colors.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>If gently whacking the set can make the color(s) come and go suddenly, then
 bad connections are probable.  The most likely place for these are solder
 pads on the little circuit board on the neck of the CRT or even dirty CRT
 socket pins that are not making solid contact.  Try prodding the CRT neck
 board with an insulated stick to see if you can affect the colors.
<p>
 Although not impossible, this is not likely to be a CRT problem.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If the color fades in and out with a delay of about 10-15 seconds, it is
 probably intermittent power to the CRT filament for that color and probably
 means a bad CRT since the three filaments are wired in parallel inside the
 CRT.  One of the internal connections has come loose.
<p>
 Look in the neck of the CRT to make sure all three filaments are glowing
 orange.  If one is out or goes on and off, toss the set.  Replacing the CRT
 is probably not worth it.  However, if they all go on and off together (all
 colors would be fading in and out though perhaps not quite in unison), then
 bad connections for the CRT filaments on the CRT neck board are indicated.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
To narrow down the problem:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Locate the output for the bad color on the video driver board on the
 neck of the CRT.   This will probably read a significantly higher
 voltage than the corresponding pins for the good colors.  A circuit
 problem is likely - probably on this board.
<p>
</p></li><li>Test components on this board for the good and bad color channels.  A
 shorted transistor or open resistor can kill one channel.  Swap parts
 between good and bad colors to confirm.
<p>
</p></li><li>Gently pull the CRT neck board off of the CRT and replace it.  This will
 tend to clean the contacts.
<p>
</p></li><li>Connect an output of the video/chroma circuit/chip that is working (i.e.,
 a color that appears on the screen) to *all* three color drivers on the CRT
 neck board.
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>If you now get a more-or-less black and white picture (there may be a
  moderate color tint as the relative intensities of R,G,B may not be
  balanced), the problem is likely with the chroma decoder or its support
  circuitry.
<p>
  Note: the picture will be the intensity of only one color channel so it
  will not be quite *normal* in any case.
</p><p>
 </p></li><li>If you still have missing or messed up colors, the problem is on the CRT
  neck board or with the CRT.
 </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
Most of the causes of intermittent colors boil down to bad connections
of one form or another.  For totally dead colors - not intermittent - bad
components are also a possibility.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Printed circuit board on the CRT neck.  This is a common location for
 cold solder joints.  Check with a bright light and magnifying glass
 for hairline cracks around the pins of larger parts.  Prod and tap with
 an insulated tool to see if the problem is effected.  Resolder if necessary.
<p>
</p></li><li>Cold solder joints elsewhere in TV or monitor usually around the pins of
 large parts such as transformers, power transistors and resistors, and
 internal connectors.
<p>
</p></li><li>Internal connectors (including CRT socket) that need to be cleaned and
 reseated.  Remove, clean with contact cleaner, burnish, and replace.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvscomtw">Some commentary on monitor and TV whacking</a></h3>

Anytime that intermittent symptoms are experienced, I recommend gently
whacking the patient to determine if mechanical shock or vibration affects
the behavior.  Here are a couple of responses to this suggestion.
<p>
(The following is from Marc Gelfond (71363.1700@CompuServe.COM).)
</p><p>
I just love the bit about "whacking it". It brings to mind an 
episode from the old Andy Griffith show, where a new fangled piece 
of electronics gear, was broght into Emmets repair shop. After 
many long hours of fruitless troubleshooting, out of frustration 
Emmet gave the thing a whack, and sure enough it fixed the  problem. 
</p><p>
As we say in the Telephony business, it "CCWT" or Came Clear While Testing.
<grin> Another saying is that it "CCBFM" Came Clear By F------ Magic!!
</grin></p><p>
(To which Gavin Adams (gaa@hopi.com) comments):
</p><p>
In the video industry we had a saying concerning malfunctioning gear:
</p><p>
"If it's broke, hit it with a hammer"<br>
"If that doesn't fix it, paint it and sell it"
</p><p>
My DEC 16" monitor is case in point. Evey once in a while it would lose sync,
and smacking it would bring it back (sometimes a few smacks).  Recently it
gave up the ghost completely, and after the local DEC office gave me a quote
of $900 to fix it (Bermuda), I ordered a new Viewsonic 17" for the same price.
</p><p>
I ripped the guts out of the DEC beast, painted it with a marble finish, put
plants in it, and sold it! :&gt;

</p><h3><a name="tvretlin">Retrace lines in picture</a></h3>

During the time the electron beam is returning from right to left at the end
of a line and bottom to top (over the course of multiple lines), it is supposed
to be result in no visible light on the screen.  However, a number of faults
can result in visible retrace lines.
<p>
The appearance will likely be a general reduction in contrast from the visible
horizontal retrace on every scan line and two dozen or so diagonal lines lines
(lower left to upper right) resulting from the vertical retrace.
</p><p>
The retrace lines may be either white or gray (possibly with a slight color
tint due to unequal settings of the color adjustments) or a primary color -
red, green, or blue.  Anything in between is also possible but less likely.

</p><h3><a name="tvwgrlin">White/gray retrace lines</a></h3>

Where all colors are involved - the lines are essentially white or gray (or
with a slight tint due to slight unequal settings of the color adjustments),
look for something common like an incorrectly adjusted screen (G2) or master
brightness/background/bias control or a problem in one of these circuits, a
defective power supply or a problem in the blanking circuitry:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Screen (G2) or master brightness/background/bias control - mark setting and
 then see if a slight adjustment removes the retrace lines.  See the chapter:
 "TV Adjustments".  Of course, if this happened suddenly, the problem is not
 due to a misadjusted control though a dirty pot is possible - turn it back
 and forth - this might clean it and restore normal operation.
<p>
</p></li><li>Power supply or connection to CRT neck board - insufficient voltage will
 result in the CRT never totally blanking.  Check (usually scan derived)
 power supply components (from flyback).
<p>
</p></li><li>General power supply - check B+ for correct value and ripple.  A main power
 supply fault might result in these symptoms (and usually many others).
<p>
</p></li><li>Blanking circuit - this may be a part of the video/chroma chip or separate.
 Check waveforms to determine if the blanking pulses are making it to the
 video output.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvrgbrlin">Red, green, or blue retrace lines</a></h3>

Where only one color is showing, suspect an incorrectly adjusted individual
background/bias control or bad part on the CRT neck board for that color.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Individual brightness/background/bias control(s) - mark setting of pot for
 the problem color and then see if a slight adjustment removes the retrace
 lines.  See the chapter: "TV Adjustments".  Of course, if this happened
 suddenly, the problem is not due to a misadjusted control though a dirty
 pot is possible - turn it back and forth - this might clean it and restore
 normal operation.
<p>
</p></li><li>Component or connection on CRT neck board - insufficient voltage to or
 incorrect biasing of the video driver for this color can result in the
 CRT never totally blanking.  Compare voltages and signals, and swap
 components between good and bad channels to confirm.
<p>
</p></li><li>Blanking circuit - this may be a part of the video/chroma chip or separate.
 Check and compare waveforms of good and bad colors to determine if the
 blanking pulses are making it to the video output.
</li></ul>
<p>
There is a slight possibility that a bad CRT may result in visible retrace
lines.  To eliminate this possibility:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Disconnect the filament - all evidence of a picture, raster, and retrace
 lines should disappear once the filaments/cathodes have cooled (15 seconds
 or so.  If there are still visible retrace lines, the CRT is suffering
 from cold or field emission from someplace (may not even be the cathode).
<p>
</p></li><li>Turn down the screen (G2) control on the flyback (usually).  If one color
 remains no matter how you set the control, again there is some kind of
 weird emission from the CRT.  However, if white/gray retrace lines remain,
 the problem may be in the screen supply.
</li></ul>
<p>
See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvbcrtcrl">Bad CRT causing retrace lines</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvbcrtcrl">Bad CRT causing retrace lines</a></h3>

(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
<p>
The TV which I bought last started developing retrace lines after a month or
so of use.  I took it back to the lab for warranty (special deal) and had it
examined by the real experts. They found that even with the filament supply
disconnected and VG2 at 0V the screen would still light up. They could even
see that the electrons weren't even coming from the cathode.  That was with
only the picture tube in a test rig.  So in this case the obvious conclusion
had to be that the  tube was bad, and it was replaced (32" 16:9 SF, very $$).
It had something to do with processing problems during manufacturing of the
electron guns. 
</p><p>
So even if this was a rare case, it *can* happen that retrace lines are due
to a bad picture tube.  It's more usual to suspect the VG2 (screen voltage)
or a defect somewhere in the RGB video path.

</p><h3><a name="tvrgbfog">Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture</a></h3>

This could be a heater-cathode (H-K) short in the CRT, a failure of a
component in the chroma circuits or video output (driver board), or bad
connections there or elsewhere.
<p>
Don't panic - heater-cathode shorts in CRTs can often be worked around.
</p><p>
Note: before proceeding, it is a good idea to make sure that the screen is
degaussed - else you could be attempting to track down problems with the wrong
color!
</p><p>
Some simple tests can confirm or rule out other possibilities.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Compare the voltages for the video drive signals to the CRT on the little
 board on the neck of the CRT with the CRT both connected and unplugged.
 A schematic will help greatly in locating these signals.
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>If there is a significant difference especially on the bad color, then the
  CRT is a likely candidate.  Try tapping the neck of the CRT GENTLY (with
  it plugged in and while viewing a picture) to see if it is an intermittent
  problem.
<p>
 </p></li><li>If there is no significant difference, you may have a bad driver or a
  problem in the chroma circuits.
 </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>Look for bad connection/cold solder joints, probably on the little
 board on the neck of the CRT.  Use an insulated stick to gently prod
 the board and its components in an effort to induce/cure the problem.
 Look carefully for hairline cracks around the component leads.
<p>
</p></li><li>You can swap components between two colors and/or test with an ohmmeter
 on that driver board to determine what is bad.  The nice thing about
 color monitors and TVs is that there three copies of each of these
 components.  Swapping and/or comparisons between these is an excellent
 diagnostic technique.
<p>
</p></li><li>Another simple test: Disconnect the cathode for the full-on color from its
 drive.  If it is still full-on, there is probably an H-K short in the CRT
 since the only way to get each color on the screen is via the cathode
 connection to the CRT neck board.  If it is removed and there is still that
 color, the current must be taking another path inside the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Alternatively, interchange the outputs of the bad color with a good one
 by jumpering on the video driver board (on the CRT neck).  If the bad
 color changes, then the problem is in the circuitry and not the CRT.
</li></ul>
<p>
 Here is the procedure in more detail (example for red full on):
</p><p>
 (From: J. K. Emerine (jkemerine@aol.com).)
</p><p>
 To identify if the fault is in the CRT or a control problem try this (WITH
 SET OFF):
</p><p>
 On the CRT board, lift the output end of the green cathode final resistor.
 Do the same with the offending red cathode's resistor.  Use short insulated
 jumpers to 'swap' drive signals - drive the red cathode with the green
 drive and the green cathode with red drive.  (Note that if this problem
 only occurs after a warmup period, color at turn on will be - well - wierd,
 but it is just a test.)
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>If the symptom returns = 'goes red' the CRT is shorting.  (See the section:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvpisofcs">Providing isolation for a CRT H-K short</a>. --- sam)
<p>
</p></li><li>If instead the symptom becomes 'goes green' then the red drive leg has
 the fault and the CRT is probably good.  (In this case, there may be bad
 connections or a bad component on the CRT drive board or further back
 in the chroma circuitry. --- sam)
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvcrtshorts">Shorts in a CRT</a></h3>

Occasionally, small conductive flakes or whiskers present since the day of
manufacture manage to make their way into a location where they short out
adjacent elements in the CRT electron guns.  Symptoms may be intermittent or
only show up when the TV or monitor is cold or warm or in-between.  Some
possible locations are listed below:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Heater to cathode (H-K).  The cathode for the affected gun will be pulled
 to the heater (filament) bias voltage - most often 0 V (signal ground).  In
 this case, one color will be full on with retrace lines.  Where the heater
 is biased at some other voltage, other symptoms are possible like reduced
 brightness and/or contrast for that color.  This is probably the most
 common location for a short to occur.
<p>
</p></li><li>Cathode to control grid (K-G1).  Since the G1 electrodes for all the guns
 are connected together, this will affect not only the color of the guilty
 cathode but the others as well.  The result may be a very bright overloaded
 *negative* picture with little, none, or messed up colors.
<p>
</p></li><li>Control grid to screen (G1-G2).  Depending on circuitry can result in any
 degree of washed out or dark picture.
<p>
</p></li><li>Screen to focus (G2-F).  Screen (G2) and focus voltage will be the same and
 the controls on the flyback will interact.  Result will be a fuzzy white
 raster with retrace lines and little or very low contrast picture.  Symptoms
 will be similar to those of a flyback with breakdown in the focus/screen
 divider network.
<p>
</p></li><li>Focus to high voltage (F-HV).  High voltage will be pulled down - probably
 arcing at the focus spark gaps/other protective devices.  Line fuse and/or
 HOT may blow.  A high impedance short may only result in increased focus
 voltage but this is probably unusual.
<p>
</p></li><li>Other locations between electron gun elements as feed wires.
</li></ul>
<p>
Except for the high voltage to other places, the short may actually be located
in the CRT *socket* or even on the CRT neck board, probably in the spark
gap(s) for the problem pins.  Remove the socket and test between the suspect
pins on the CRT itself.  If the CRT itself is fine, the spark gaps should be
inspected and cleaned/repaired and/or components replaced.  At this point, the
cause may still be present - a short inside the flyback for example resulting
in excessive voltage on one or more pins.
</p><p>
Assuming this is not the case, replacing the CRT may be the best solution
but there are a variety of 'techniques' that can often be used to salvage a
TV that would otherwise end up in the dump since replacing a CRT is
rarely cost effective:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Isolation - this will usually work for H-K shorts as long as only one gun
 is involved.
<p>
</p></li><li>Blowing out the short with a capacitor - depending on what is causing the
 short, this may be successful but will require some experimentation.
<p>
</p></li><li>Placing the CRT (TV or monitor) face down on a soft blanket and *gently*
 tapping the neck to dislodge the contamination.  Depending on the location
 of the short, one side or the other might be better as well.  Sometimes,
 this can be done in-place while watching the picture.
</li></ol>
<p>
A combination of (2) and (3) may be required for intermittent shorts which
don't appear until under power.  See the sections below for additional
details.  However, for shorts involving the focus and high voltage elements,
even a sharp edge can result in arcing even if there is no actual short.
There is no remedy for these types of faults.

</p><h3><a name="tvpisofcs">Providing isolation for a CRT H-K short</a></h3>

This procedure will substitute a winding of your own for the one that is
built in to the flyback to isolate the shorted filament from the ground
or voltage reference.  Note that if you have a schematic and can determine
where to disconnect the ground or voltage reference connection to the
filament winding, try this instead.
<p>
The flyback is the thing with the fat red wire coming out of it (and perhaps
a couple of others going to the CRT board or it is near this component
if your set has a separate tripler) and may have a couple of controls for
focus and screen.  It should have some exposed parts with a ferrite core
about 1/2-3/4" diameter.
</p><p>
The filament of the CRT is the internal heater for each gun - it is what
glows orange when the set is on.  What has happened is that a part of the
fine wire of the bad color's filament (assuming this is indeed your problem)
has shorted to the cathode - the part that actually emits the electrons.
Normally, the heater circuit is grounded or tied to a reference voltage
so when it shorts to the cathode, the cathode voltage level is pulled to
ground or this reference.
</p><p>
You will need some well insulated wire, fairly thick (say #18-22).  Find a
spot on the flyback where you can stick this around the core.  Wrap two
turns around the core and solder to the CRT filament pins after cutting the
connections to the original filament source (scribe the traces on the board
to break them).  Make sure you do not accidentally disconnect anything else.
</p><p>
This winding should cause the filaments to glow about the same brightness as
before but now isolated from ground.  If they are too dim, put another turn
on the flyback to boost the voltage as this will result in low emission,
blooming, and possible damage to the cathodes after awhile.  (Don't go
overboard as you may blow the filament totally if you put too many turns on
the core - you then toss the TV.)
</p><p>
Route the wires so that there is no chance of them getting near the high
voltage or any sharp metal edges etc.  Your picture quality may be a tad
lower than it was before because of the added stray capacitance of the
filament wiring being attached to the the (formerly bad) video signal, but
hey, something is better than nothing.
</p><p>
If you are not inclined to build your own isolation transformers, kits are
available.

</p><h3><a name="tvrescuesc">Rescuing a shorted CRT</a></h3>

If the short is filament-cathode (H-K), you don't want to use the following
approach since you may blow out the filament in the process.  If this is the
case, you may be able to float the filament and live with the short (see the
section on: "Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture".
<p>
Shorts in the CRT that are between directly accessible electrodes can
be dealt with in a more direct way than for H-K shorts.  At this point
you have nothing to loose.  A shorted CRT is not real useful.
</p><p>
If the short is between two directly accessible electrodes like cathode-grid,
then as a last resort, you might try zapping it with a charged capacitor.
Start with a relatively small capacitor - say a few uF at a couple hundred
volts.  Check to see if the short is blown after each zap - few may be needed.
Increase the capacitance if you fell lucky but have had little success with
the small capacitor.
</p><p>
If the fault is intermittent, you will, of course, need to catch the CRT
with the socket disconnected and the short still present.  Try some gentle
tapping if necessary.  If you do this with the charged capacitor across
the suspect electrode, you **will** know when the short occurs!

It is possible to replace the picture tube.  However, this is likely to

</p><ul>
<li>Discharge both the old and new tubes before you start to be sure you won't

</p><p>
What you have here is genericly referred to as the 25V as opposed to the 25A
picture tube. While there are minor differences with respect to the letters
after the V for the most part they are interchangeable. When I worked my way
through engineering college I worked at a TV repair shop and my job was mostly
changing picture tubes. Yeah, we did enough of them to keep a tech busy 4 to 5
hours a day changing them and I got pretty good and could change, color
balance, convergence, etc. the tube in about 45 minutes. We for the most part
used 3 major tubes, 1) 25A, 2) 25V, and 3) 21FJ (a little nostalgic for those
who remember this one). This was back when your TV would have been fairly new
(1981 to 82). These are available from many different sources - RCA, Channel
Master, Wisconsin Tube, etc. The price would vary depending on the quality of
the tube. I remember that we could get a 25A for about $35 at the time due to
our volume - one truck per month. The most expensive I've seen them has been
just over $200. This is quite a range and there are now many other types of
tubes including in-line, trinitron, etc. 
</p><p>
I hope this helps and thanks for the trip down memory lane!
</p><p>
(From: Chris Jardine (cjardine@wctc.net).)
</p><p>
The important thing here is that the tube begins with 25V. If it does it should
work in your set. The only thing you have to know is whether the tube has
'ears' attached permanently. The 25V comes both with and without these mounting
ears permanently attached. I know that you can still get one of these from any
of a number of suppliers. I know that Channel Master and RCA (Thomson,
whatever!) still make them available as well as any of a number of local CRT
rebuilders.

</p><h3><a name="tvhvtfs">High voltage to focus short</a></h3>

Symptoms would be (with the unit powered and high voltage present):
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>With the CRT neck board plugged into the CRT, the focus spark gap is likely
 arcing.
<p>
</p></li><li>With the socket unplugged, putting anything connected to ground (or any
 other circuitry) near the focus pin would result in a juicy spark or arc.
 WARNING: Removing the CRT socket and powering the set may destroy the CRT
 on some models.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvwarndcn">Warning about
 disconnecting CRT neck board</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
If the CRT is gassy or up to air, forget it - it might make a decent fish
tank :-).  In this case, there would be visible arcing INSIDE the CRT probably
not confined to a single location.
</p><p>
However, if there is just a metal whisker between the F and HV, that might
be able to be cleared by careful tapping or a charged capacitor.  You may even
be able to see it if you were to remove the yoke - the gap is pretty large,
about 1-2 mm - the last gap between electrodes before the start of the
internal (Dag) coating.
</p><p>
See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrescuesc">Rescuing a shorted CRT</a>.
</p><p>
Note that other damage may have been done as
</p><p>
Other components including the flyback, HOT, and parts on the CRT neck board
and beyond, may have been damaged as a result of the short.  Zapping the CRT
may be just the beginning of what is required to repair it all.

</p><h3><a name="tvdarkpic">Dark picture</a></h3>

A TV or monitor with a picture that is too dark may have a fault or the CRT may
just be near the end of its useful life.
<p>
First, confirm that your video source - computer, camera, etc. - is producing
a proper signal.
</p><p>
Is the brightness at all erratic?  Does whacking the monitor have any effect?
If so, then you may have bad connections on the CRT driver card or elsewhere.
If the brightness tends to fade in and out over a 10 to 20 second period,
a bad filament connection is likely.  Check for the normal orange glow of
the filaments in the neck of the CRT.  There should be 3 orange glows.  If
they are excessively reddish, very dim, or fade in and out, you have located
a problem.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvpicfade">Picture fades in and out</a>.
</p><p>
Common causes of brightness problems:
</p><p>
</p><ol start="0">
<li>Dirty CRT faceplate or safety glass.  Don't laugh.  It sounds obvious, but
 have you tried cleaning the screen with suitable screen cleaner?  It is
 amazing how dirty screens can get after a few years - especially around
 smokers!
<p>
 Wipe gently with a slightly dampened cloth - not soaking or you may end
 up with real problems when the water drips down inside and hits the
 electronics!  On TVs with a separate protective faceplate, clean both
 the front and rear surfaces of this plate as well as the CRT itself.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Old CRT.  The brightness of the CRT deteriorates with on-time.  It does not
 matter much how bright your run your TV.  An indication of a weak CRT would
 be that turning up the SCREEN (G2) or master brightness control only results
 in a not terribly bright gray raster before the retrace lines show up.
 There may be indications of poor focus and silvery highlights as well.  A
 CRT brightener may help.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvbrightcrt">Brightening
 an old CRT</a>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad component in filament circuit or bad connection reducing filament
 voltage.  This should be easy to check - there are only a few parts
 involved.  If it is erratic, bad connections are likely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Brightness control faulty - bad pot, bad connections, or problem with its
 power supply.  Depending on specific problem, control may or may not have
 any effect.  If digitally adjusted, there could be a problem with the
 logic or control chip.  If the button or menu item has no effect at all,
 then a logic or control problem is likely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Improperly set SCREEN (G2) voltage (usually on flyback) or faulty divider
 network.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvadjscc">Adjustment of the internal
 SCREEN and color controls</a>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Improperly set video bias (background) levels or fault in video drive
 circuitry.  See the sections starting with: "Optimal procedure for setting
 brightness/background and screen adjustments".
<p>
</p></li><li>Fault in video amplifiers.  With all three color affected equally, this
 would most likely be a power supply problem.  A video amplifier problem
 is likely if turning up the SCREEN (G2) or master brightenss control
 results in a very bright raster before the retrace lines appear.  Cheack
 signals out of the video/chroma(IC.
<p>
</p></li><li>Fault in beam or brightness limiter.  Many TVs and monitors measure the
 beam current (possibly indirectly) and limit the maximum to a safe value.
 The purpose of this may be to protect the CRT phosphors, and/or to assure
 that the power supply does not go out of regulation, and/or to limit X-ray
 emission.  If this circuit screws up, a dark picture may result.  Checking
 the signals and voltages at the CRT socket should determine if this is the
 problem.
<p>
</p></li><li>High voltage is low.  However, this would likely result in other symptoms
 as well with focus, size, and geometry.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvbrightcrt">Brightening an old CRT</a></h3>

If performing adjustments of the internal background and/or screen controls
still results in a dark picture even after a long warmup period, the CRT
may simply be near the end of its useful life.  In the old days of TVs
with short lived CRTs, the CRT brightener was a common item (sold in every
corner drugstore, it seemed!).
<p>
You can try a similar approach.  Caution: this may shorten the life of
the CRT - possibly quite dramatically (like it will blow in a couple of
seconds or minutes).  However, if the monitor or TV is otherwise destined
for the scrap heap, it is worth a try.
</p><p>
The approach is simple: you are going to increase the voltage to the
filaments of the electron guns making them run hotter.  Hopefully, just
hotter enough to increase the brightness without blowing them out.
</p><p>
Voltage for the CRT filament is usually obtained from a couple of turns
on the flyback transformer.  It is usually easy to add an extra turn or two
which will increase the voltage and thus the current making the filaments
run hotter.  This will also shorten the CRT life - perhaps rather drastically.
However, if the TV or monitor was headed for the dumpster anyhow, you have
nothing to lose.

</p><h3><a name="tvptbright">Picture tube brightener</a></h3>

(From: Kevin Carney (carneyke@mhv.net).)
<p>
Try a CRT brightener from MCM Electronics about $20. It boosts the
filament voltage a volt or two. I have used them before and they help.
You can also try running a power supply on the filament with the
monitor OFF. Set the supply at the filament voltage and slowly bring
the voltage up. If the filament is 6.3 volt bring it up gradually to
10 -12 volts for about a half hour. This will brighten it up some.
Be careful because too much voltage can open the filament !
</p><p>
Before doing this did you check the screen voltage setting and the
RGB settings for drive and background ?
</p><p>
There are also commercial CRT rejuvenators that supposedly zap the
cathodes of the electron guns.  A TV repair shop may be able to
provide this service, though it is, at best, a short term fix.

</p><h3><a name="tvmdmbcrt">More drastic measures to brighten CRT</a></h3>

(From: LEE (leep@mailhub.scf.lmsc.lockheed.com).)
<p>
As a start, I crank the brightness control all of the way up. I then turn the
color control all of the way up. I let the set run with a bright screen for
around 15 min. This procedure cleans up the cathode surfaces so that they can
emit more electrons. Now turn the controls back to normal and see if any 
improvement took place.  If not, Wrap 2 or 3 turns of around 18 gauge insulated
wire around the flyback and add this extra power in series with existing
filament leads from flyback. You can experiment with the number of turns etc.
to get brighter filaments. do not run the filaments white - just a brightened
yellow. This will probably turn out to be around 8-9v in most cases. I had to
do this on two different Sanyo replacement flybacks as they had low filament
voltage from the factory. (flakey replacement parts).  I`ve been running one of
these Sanyos for around 4 years now with a nice bright picture (13")

</p><h3><a name="tvlpsdof">Left portion of screen is dark or faded</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I've got an old TV where the left 1/3 of the screen is 'faded'.  It is
 especially noticable when a dark picture is showing (like a night time
 scene)."
</blockquote>
<p>
This is normally caused by a bad filter capacitor on the power supply line
(typically 200 V) that feeds the RGB output transistors. It is usually a scan
derived voltage off of the flyback.  Look for an electrolytic capacitor of
around 4.7 to 10 uF, 160 to 250 V fed from a rectifier diode on this supply. 

</p><h3><a name="tvcbcaslr">Color balance changes across screen from left to right</a></h3>

The characteristics are that a solid white screen will tend to be blue tinted
on one side and red tinted on the other.  This is usually a subtle effect and
may be unavoidable with some designs.
<p>
There are several possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Purity - this means the beams are landing on the wrong phosphor dots.
 This is what would be affected by moving from one location to another
 or even rotating the TV on its base without degaussing.  If the problem
 just appeared, degaussing may be needed.
<p>
 What do you have near the TV or monitor?  Loudspeakers or other devices
 which generate magnetic fields can easily cause all sorts of color purity
 problems.  Relocate the offending device(s) or the TV or monitor and then
 degauss it.
</p><p>
 See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT</a>.
</p><p>
 If the problem still persists, purity adjustment may be needed.  However,
 this isn't likely to  have changed so look for other causes before tackling
 these adjustments.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Unequal electron gun to shadowmask/screen distance - the electron beams for
 the red and blue video travel slightly different distances on the left and
 right sides of the screen so their intensity (due to focus not being optimal
 and other factors) in each case may differ slightly affecting color balance.
<p>
</p></li><li>Doming - This would only happen in very bright areas and causes the
 shadow mask to expand and distort.  (Doming should not be a problem with
 Trinitron CRTs which use tensioned wires in their aperture grill.)  This
 would also not really affect left-right color balance in particular.
</li></ol>
<p>
I don't really know how much of a problem (2) is in practice or whether some
manufacturers compensate for it.

</p><h3><a name="tvbleedhigh">Bleeding highlights</a></h3>

On very bright areas of the picture, one or more colors may bleed to
the right resulting in a trail of those colors.  The difference between
this problem and the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtrailine">Trailing lines in
one or more colors</a> is that in this case, only highlights are affected.
<p>
One cause of this is that the color gain, contrast, or intensity controls
(whatever they are called on your set) are set too high.  See the section
on: "Color balance adjustment".  Check the settings of any brightness limiter
controls as well.

</p><h3><a name="tvtrailine">Trailing lines in one or more colors</a></h3>

Assuming this is not a form of ghosting resulting from poor reception
conditions, then it could be any of the following:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Poor decoupling in the power supplies for the video drive circuits - probably
 on the CRT neck board.  Check for bad (low uF or high ESR) filter capacitors
 (electrolytic mostly) on this board or the power supplies feeding it.
<p>
</p></li><li>Insufficient CRT filament voltage.  This could be a result of bad connections
 or a bad component in the filament power supply (probably from the flyback).
 Check to see if the filaments are glowing bright orange and check the voltage
 if possible (though this can be tricky since it is often fed from a winding
 on the flyback and is a pulse waveform, not DC or a sinusoid.  The service
 manual (or Sams' Photofact) will probably have info and waveforms.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad CRT (more likely if only one color is affected).  A weak electron gun can
 result in this behavior.  Swap it with one that work properly.  If the same
 color is still bad, that CRT gun is weak.  The CRT will need rejuvenation or
 need to be replaced (more likely, the entire TV will be tossed into the
 dumpster).
</li></ul>
<p>
One simple test would be to swap two of the color outputs to the CRT
pins.  If the behavior moves with the swap (i.e., from red to blue), then it
is likely an electronic problem.  If it is still the same colors, it is
probably the CRT.

</p><h3><a name="tvbccltras">Brightness changes from left-to-right across screen</a></h3>

Slight variations in brightness across the face of the CRT are not unusual.
In fact, if you used a photometer to actually measure the brightness, you
might be amazed at the actual variance even with the best monitor or TV - you
just don't notice it.  However, a major variation - usually a decay from left
to right but could be the other way indicate a component failure.  Of course,
make sure the face of the screen is clean!
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A fault in the power supplies to the video amplifier and/or video output
 circuits.  Most likely, an electrolytic capacitor has dried up and is not
 adequately filtering the power derived from the flyback which then has
 ripple at the horizontal scan rate and thus locked to the screen.  The
 voltage decays from left-to-right between horizontal flyback pulses.
<p>
 The most likely location for these capacitors is in the vicinity of the
 flyback transformer on the mainboard or on the CRT neck board.  Check the
 capacitors with capacitor tester or ESR meter and/or take a look at the
 power right at the video amplifier and video output drivers.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal linearity is bad - this may actually be a horizontal geometry
 problem and not a brightness problem.
<p>
 See if objects on left side of the screen are stretched compared to those on
 the right (or vice-versa).  If they are, the problem is in the horizontal
 deflection circuits - possibly a bad S correction capacitor or linearity
 coil.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Inoperative degauss circuit, TV moved or rotated without degaussing, or
 magnetic field from some other device (like a permanent magnet) is affecting
 CRT - slight amounts of magnetization may reduce brightness (by moving the
 beams into the black space between phosphor dots) before affecting color
 purity (where the beams land on the wrong phosphor dots).
<p>
 Try deguassing manually.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing
 (demagnetizing) a CRT</a>.
</p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvpicfade">Picture fades in and out</a></h3>

If the picture faded away on the order of 10-20 seconds (and if it comes
back, also comes up to full brightness in same time frame - possibly
with the persuasion of some careful whacking) AND with NO other
significant changes such as size, focus, etc., then take a look in the back of
the tube for the filament to be lit - the orange glow near the CRT socket.  If
there is none, then you probably have a bad solder connection on the circuit
board on the neck of the CRT.  Look for fine cracks around pins on that board.
Try prodding it with an insulating stick to see if the picture comes back.
Resolder if necessary.  Dirty or corroded CRT pins/socket contacts can also
do this - remove, inspect, clean, and replace the neck board.  It is probably
not a bad CRT as the filaments are usually wired in parallel and all would not
likely go bad at the same time.
<p>
However, if only a single color fades in and out, then a bad connection
inside the CRT is a distinct possibility - look for only one of the
filament's glow to be coming and going.  This is probably not worth fixing.
</p><p>
If the picture faded away with other symptoms, then there is probably
a fault in the video amplifier/output one of its power supplies -
still probably a loose connection if you are able to get it back by
whacking.

</p><h3><a name="tvobrightfl">Occasional brightness flashes</a></h3>

These may last only a fraction of a scan line or much much longer.
<p>
This could mean an intermittent fault in a variety of places including
the video circuitry and SCREEN power supply:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Brightness circuitry - SCREEN, master background or its power supply.
 Could be in or around flyback or focus/screen divider.  Could perhaps
 be in the CRT, but probably less likely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Video amp before or at chroma demodulator - since after this point, you would
 most likely get colored flashes since only one of the RGB signals would
 likely be effected.
</li></ul>
<p>
If you get it from all sources, then tuner/IF is ruled out.
</p><p>
Suppose you just have no signal to a direct video input.  What do you
get?  If you still get flashes, it should be real easy to monitor either
the video outputs or SCREEN supply (with a HV divider on your scope) for
noise.  Then trace back to power or noise source.

</p><h3><a name="tvebaowop">Excessive brightness and/or washed out picture</a></h3>

There are a number of possibilities including incorrect screen (G2) or bias
(G1) voltages, or a problem in the video or blanking circuitry.  Any of these
could be the result of bad connections as well.  A short in the CRT can also
result in these symptoms.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Excessive brightness/washed out picture is often an indication of a
 problem with the screen (G2) supply to the CRT.  May be a bad capacitor
 or resistor divider often in the flyback transformer assembly or on 
 the board on the neck of the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the excessive brightness just developed over time, then a simple
 adjustment of the screen or background brightness controls may keep
 it (and you) happy for a long time.
<p>
 When good, a typical value would be in the 200 to 600 VDC at the CRT.  The
 screen (it may also be called master brightness, bias, or background) control
 should vary this voltage.  However, it may be difficult to measure as the
 resistors in the voltage divider network may be quite large - hundreds of M
 ohms.  If your unit has an external screen control (less likely these days)
 and it has no effect, trace out the circuitry in the immediate vicinity and
 check the resistors and potentiometer for opens, look for bad connections,
 etc.  If it is built into the flyback transformer and is sealed, the entire
 flyback will need to be replaced unless the actual problem turns out to be a
 bad connection or bad component external to the flyback.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Where the brightness control has no effect, suspect a missing bias supply to
 the G1 (control grid) electrodes of the CRT.  This is usually derived from
 the flyback with a simple rectifier/filter capacitor power supply.  Parts
 may have failed (though not likely the flyback itself).  Adjusting the user
 brightness control should vary this voltage over a typical range of 0 to -50
 V with respect to signal ground.
<p>
</p></li><li>It could also be a problem with biasing of the video output transistors.
 There may individual controls for background brightness on the little board
 on the neck of the CRT.  However, we are looking for a common problem since
 all colors are wrong in the same way.  This is likely to be a missing voltage
 from a secondary supply from the flyback.
<p>
</p></li><li>A short between electrodes inside the CRT can result in brightness problems.
 It may be possible to check this with an ohmmeter with the power off and the
 CRT socket removed.  Test between G1, G2, and F where all colors are
 affected though a short between F and G2 will result in the focus control
 changing brightness and vice-versa - a classic symptom.
<p>
 However, in some cases, it only shows up when operating and one must deduce
 the presense and location of the short from its affect on voltages and bias
 levels.
</p><p>
 See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrescuesc">Rescuing a shorted CRT</a> and other
 related topics.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
First, check for bad connections/cold solder joints by gently prodding
with an insulating stick.  Check voltages and bias levels.

</p><h3><a name="tvbadfocus">Bad focus (fuzzy picture)</a></h3>

Focus voltage on the CRT is usually in the range of 2-8 kV DC and should
be controllable over a fairly wide range by the focus pot - usually located
on the flyback or a little panel in its vicinity:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If adjusting the pot results in a position of acceptable focus, you may be
 done.  It is not unusual for the focus setting to drift a over time.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the setting is already as good as possible but not really good enough,
 the CRT may be tired.  Alternatively, the filament voltage may be too low.
 Check for bad connections in the filament circuit.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the optimal setting is out of range of the focus pot, the problem is
 likely leakage in the focus divider in the flyback or one of the components
 on the CRT neck board.
</li></ul>
<p>
Also see the sections: "Focus adjustment" and "Focus drifts with warmup".
</p><p>
The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or if the general area or from a
terminal on a voltage multiplier module in some cases.  It is usually a wire
by itself going to the little board on the neck of the CRT.
</p><p>
If a sparkgap (a little 2 terminal device with a 1/8" gap in the middle)
is arcing with power on, then the resistive divider has shorted inside
the flyback, focus board, or HV multiplier - whatever you TV has - and
the this unit will need to be replaced.  Ditto if the SCREEN control affects
focus and/or vice-versa.
</p><p>
Using a suitable high voltage meter (range at least 10 kVDC, 1000 M ohm or
greater input impedance), you should be able to measure it connected and
disconnected.  The ground return will be the outside coating of the CRT which
may or may not be the same as the metal chassis parts.  If the voltage is very
low (less than 2 kV) or too high and the pot has little effect:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>When measured right off of the source disconnected from the CRT neck board,
 then the problem is probably in the focus network in the flyback (or wherever
 it originates).  Sometimes these can be disassembled and cleaned or repaired
 but usually requires replacement of the entire flyback or voltage multiplier.
 Note: you may need to add a HV (10 kV) capacitor between the focus wire and

 short between the focus and another electrode inside the CRT.  See the

<p>
</p></li><li>When measured with the focus wire attached to the CRT neck board with the

</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvfocdrift">Focus drift with warmup</a></h3>

This could be due to a problem with the focus voltage power supply, components
on the CRT neck board, or a tired worn CRT.
<p>
Focus is controlled by a voltage of 2-8 kV DC usually derived from the flyback
transformer and includes some resistors and capacitors.  One of these could
be changing value as it warms up. (assuming nothing else changes significantly
as the unit warms up - e.g., the brightness does not decrease.)
</p><p>
Focus voltage is derived from a subset of the high voltage winding on the
flyback using a resistive voltage divider which includes the focus pot.
These are extremely high value resistors - 200 M ohm is common - and so
leakage of any kind can reduce or increase the focus voltage.  All other
things being ok - i.e., the picture is otherwise fine - I would suspect this
type of failure rather than the CRT.
</p><p>
The connection to the CRT is usually a separate wire running from the flyback
or its neighborhood to the CRT neck board.  Look for components in this
general area.  Use cold spray or a heat gun to isolate the one that is
drifting.  If you have access to a high voltage meter, you should be able
to see the voltage change as the TV or monitor warms up - and when you cool
the faulty part.  If it is in the flyback, then sometimes the part with the
adjustments clips off and can be repaired or cleaned.  Most often, you will
need to replace the flyback as a unit.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>If the optimal adjustment point of the focus control doesn't change that
 much but the best focus is simply not as good as it should be, the CRT is
 probably the problem.  However, if the optimal point produces acceptable
 focus but it changes (and possibly moves off of one end of the adjustment
 knob range) as the unit warms up, the flyback or one of the components on
 the CRT neck board are likely drifting.
<p>
</p></li><li>If you have a high voltage meter, you can measure the focus voltage to 
 determine if it is being changed by the focus pot and if it is in the
 ball park (2-8 kV typical).  Sometimes, the part of the flyback with the
 focus pot can be snapped off and cleaned or parts replaced but usually you
 need to replace the whole unit.  There may a capacitor or two on the PCB on
 the neck of the CRT that could have increased leakage as well thus reducing
 the focus voltage.
<p>
</p></li><li>To determine if the CRT is the problem, for sharp focus after the unit has
 warmed up.  Power-off for an hour or so and carefully pull the CRT neck board
 off of the CRT.  Then, power up the unit.  Let it run long enough such that
 there would have been a detectable focus drift.  Now, power-down, plug the
 CRT neck board back in, and power-up.  Watch the image as it appears on the
 screen:
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>If the focus starts out fuzzy and sharpens up as the image appears and
  gradually becomes sharper as the CRT warms up the CRT is likely tired.
<p>
  The only catch here is that plugging the CRT neck board into the CRT
  results in an additional load on the flyback due to the picture beam
  current which heats it more as well.  Thus, if the problem takes a few
  minutes to appear, keep the brightness turned down except to check the
  appearance of the picture from time to time. 
</p><p>
  You can set the focus control for optimum when warmed up and just turn
  the TV on in well in advance of your favorite shows or add a user focus
  adjustment by drilling a hole in the plastic case for an *insulated*
  screwdriver or flyback focus knob extender :-).  The CRT may continue
  to function for quite a while so this is not impending doom.
</p><p>
 </p></li><li>If the focus is relatively stable as the image appears and increases
  in brightness *and* is about as sharp as it would be with the TV warmed
  up, the problem is most likely in the flyback.  However, also check for
  bad components or decayed (tan or brown) glue on the CRT neck board.  A
  drifting flyback will need to be replaced as it will probably get worse
  and fail completely.  Clean the surface of the circuit board and CRT
  socket in the vicinity of the focus and screen terminals and traces.
  Contamination or just dirt and grime can easily cause problems especially
  on humid days since the resistance of these circuits is extremely high
  (100s of M ohms).
<p>
 </p></li><li>If the focus is relatively stable as the image appears and increases
  in brightness *and* is similar to what it would be with the monitor cold,
  you have a very strange situation where some load on the high voltage
  power supply, perhaps, is causing a thermal problem.  This would be rare.
 </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvbfocacb">Bad focus and adjustment changes brightness</a></h3>

This is the classic symptom of a short between the focus and screen
supplies - probably in focus/screen divider which is part of the flyback
or tripler.  If you have a high voltage meter, measuring the focus voltage
will show that (1) it is low and (2) it is affected by the SCREEN control
Similarly, the SCREEN voltage will be affected by the FOCUS control (which
is what is changing the brightness.
<p>
There is a slight possibility that this may be in the CRT as well.  Measure
the FOCUS and SCREEN voltage with a high voltage meter.  If they are identical
pull the plug on the CRT.  If they are now their normal values, then a
shorted CRT is a distinct possibility - see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrescuesc">Rescuing a shorted CRT</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvccofprb">Charlie's comments on focus problems</a></h3>

(From: Charles Godard (cgodard@iamerica.net).)
<p>
Most true focus problems that I have encountered (when the IHVT is ok) are
related to leaks or resistance on the focus output.  The diming of the screen
when the focus pot is adjusted leads me to think in terms of a leaky socket.
I'd remove the ground from the CRT socket to the tube dag and see if it
sparks.  If so there may be a leak in the socket to ground.  It could also be
leaking to another pin, such as the screen grid. A rhetorical question: What
happens to the screen voltage when the focus pot is adjusted?
</p><p>
I have seen sockets that had no arching or other telltale signs, leak through
the plastic housing to ground out the focus voltage.
</p><p>
Look closely at the screen.  If the blurring is in the form of small circles,
then you have an open or hi-resistance focus electrode inside the tube.  The
circles may vary in visibility with brightness.
</p><p>
If you still haven't found the problem, try to confirm that this is truly a
focus problem.  Remove the CRT socket and observe the hi-voltage.  If it
climbs more than about 1k, say all the way up to 25 kV, then you may have a
beam current problem rather than a focus problem.  In that case re-check all
CRT board voltages.  WARNING: Removing the CRT socket and powering the set
may destroy the CRT on some models.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvwarndcn">Warning about disconnecting CRT neck board</a>.
</p><p>
If you have done all of the above and removing the socket makes no change in
the high voltage, then try to determine why the high voltage is low.
</p><p>
Watch the screen as the brightness, contrast, or screen control are adjusted.
See if you can observe any signs of blooming.  When the IHVT doesn't provide
enough current to satisfy the demands of the tube for current, the the picture
tends to appear to expand like a balloon. i.e., bloom.  This can be caused by
not enough drive to the IHVT. Carefully monitor the b+ to the horizontal drive
stages to see that is is stable and correct.

</p><h3><a name="tvblankpic">Blank picture, good channel tuning and sound</a></h3>

Since the tuner and sound are ok, horizontal deflection which usually
generates power for most of the set is also working.
<p>
Does 'blank picture' means a totally black screen with the brightness and 
contrast controls having no effect whatsoever?  Or, is there is no picture
but there is a raster - scan lines on the screen?  The direction in which
troubleshooting should proceed differ significantly depending the answer.
</p><p>
Here are some questions:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>As above, is there any light on the screen at any settings of the brightness
 and contrast controls, and/or when switching channels?  Can you see any
 raster scanning lines?
<p>
</p></li><li>Can you hear the high pitched (15735 Hz) of the horizontal deflection?
<p>
</p></li><li>Looking in the back of the set, can you see the glow of the CRT filament?
<p>
</p></li><li>Do you get that static on the front of the tube that would indicate that
 there is high voltage?  Any cracking or other normal or abnormal sounds
 or smells?
</li></ol>
<p>
Possible causes of no raster:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>No or low high voltage (low voltage, deflection, or high voltage power
 supply failure).
<p>
</p></li><li>Fault with other voltages like G1 or screen (G2) to CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Filament to CRT not getting powered.
<p>
</p></li><li>Drive to CRT bad/shut off as a result of fault elsewhere.  For example,
 failure of the vertical deflection may disable HV or blank the screem to
 protect the CRT from burn-in due to the very bright horizontal line that
 would result.  With some sets, it is possible that the X-ray protection
 circuitry will blank the screen without affecting tuning or audio.
</li></ul>
<p>
Possible causes of no video (but a good raster): Problem in video IF, video
amplifiers, video output, cutoff due to other fault.
</p><p>
It could be as simple as a bad connection - try gently prodding the boards
with an insulated stick while watching the screen.  Check for loose connectors
and reseat all internal connectors.

</p><h3><a name="tvpblob">Purple blob - or worse</a></h3>

Have you tried demagnetizing it?  Try powering it off for a half hour, then
on.  Repeat a couple of times.  This should activate the internal degausser.
See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvdegacrt">Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT</a>.
<p>
Is there any chance that someone waved a magnet hear the tube?  Remove it
and/or move any items like monster speakers away from the set.
</p><p>
Was your kid experimenting with nuclear explosives - an EMP would magnetize
the CRT.  Nearby lightning strikes may have a similar effect.
</p><p>
If demagnetizing does not help, then it is possible that something shifted
on the CRT - there are a variety of little magnets that are stuck on at the
time of manufacture to adjust purity.  There are also service adjustments
but it is unlikely (though not impossible) that these would have shifted
suddenly.  This may be a task for a service shop but you can try your
hand at it if you get the Sams' Photofact or service manual - don't attempt
purity adjustments without one.
</p><p>
If the set was dropped, then the internal shadow mask of the CRT may have
become distorted or popped loose and you now have a hundred pound paper
weight. :(  If the discoloration is slight, some
carefully placed 'refrigerator' magnets around the periphery of the tube might
help.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvmfixfpp">Magnet fix for purity problems -
if duct tape works, use it!</a>.
</p><p>
It is even possible that this is a 'feature' complements of the manufacturer.
If certain components like transformers and loudspeakers are of inferior
design and/or are located too close to the CRT, they could have an effect
on purity.  Even if you did not notice the problem when the set was new,
it might always have been marginal and now a discoloration is visible due
to slight changes or movement of components over time.

</p><h3><a name="tvcrings">Color rings - bullseye pattern</a></h3>

This probably means the degaussing circuitry is terminating suddenly instead
of gradually as it should.  The most likely cause is a bad solder connection
to the degauss thermistor or posistor or something feeding it.
<p>
You can confirm this by manually degaussing the screen with the TV or monitor
turned on.  If the problem disappears, the above diagnosis is probably valid.
Check for bad solder connections in the vicinity of the degauss components
and AC line input.

</p><h3><a name="tvmfixfpp">Magnet fix for purity problems - if duct tape works, use it!</a></h3>

The approach below will work for slight discoloration that cannot be eliminated
through degaussing.  However, following the procedures in the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvcrtpura">CRT purity adjustment</a> would be the preferred solution.
On the other hand, the magnets may be quick and easy.  And, where CRT has
suffered internal distortion or dislocation of the shadowmask, adjustments
may not be enough.
<p>
In any case, first, relocate those megablaster loudspeakers and that MRI
scanner with the superconducting magnets.
</p><p>
The addition of some moderate strength magnets carefully placed to reduce or
eliminate purity problems due to a distorted or dislocated shadowmask may be
enough to make the TV usable - if not perfect.  The type of magnets you want
are sold as 'refrigerator magnets' and the like for sticking up notes on steel
surfaces.  These will be made of ferrite material (without any steel) and will
be disks, rectangles, flexible strips.  Experiment with placement using
masking tape to hold them in place temporarily.  Degauss periodically to
evaluate the status of your efforts.  Then, make the 'repair' permanent using
duct tape or silicone sealer or other household adhesive.
</p><p>
Depending on the severity of the purity problem, you may need quite a few
magnets!  However, don't get carried away and use BIG speaker or magnetron
magnets - you will make the problems worse.
</p><p>
Also note that unless the magnets are placed near the front of the CRT, very
significant geometric distortion of the picture will occur - which may be a
cure worse than the disease.
</p><p>
WARNING: Don't get carried away while positioning the magnets - you will be
near some pretty nasty voltages!
</p><p>
(From: Mr. Caldwell (jcaldwel@iquest.net).)
</p><p>
I ended up with the old 'stuck on a desert island trick':
</p><p>
I duck taped 2 Radio Shack magnets on the case, in such a way
as to pull the beam back.!!!!
</p><p>
A $2 solution to a $200 problem.  My friend is happy as heck.
</p><p>
RCA sells magnets to correct corner convergence, they are shaped like chevrons 
and you stick them in the 'right' spot on the rear of the CRT.
</p><p>
(From: Tom Sedlemyer (wesvid@gte.net).)
</p><p>
First set purity as best you can.
</p><p>
Obtain some pieces of refrigerator door magnet strips from an appliance
repair shop (they usually have some lying around).
</p><p>
Cut the strips into 1 inch pieces.  Place a strip as on the bell of the
picture tube as close to the yoke as possible and in line with the corner that
has the purity error.   Rotate the magnet until you correct the purity error
and tape it in place. Multiple magnet strips can be used and you may
experiment with the size of the strips for best effect.  It is very important
that the strips are positioned close to the yoke or the effect will not hold.
The only drawback to this method is some very slight distortion of the
geometry of the raster, but it beats hell out of paying for a new CRT.

</p><h3><a name="tvctvodoc">Color TV only displays one color</a></h3>

I assume that now you have no other colors at all - no picture and no
raster.  Let us say it is red - R.
<p>
It is probably not the CRT.  Do you have a scope?  Check for the R, G,
and B video signals at the CRT.  You will probably find no signals
for the defective colors.
</p><p>
This is almost certainly a chroma circuit problem as any failure of the
CRT or a video driver would cause it to lose a single color - the other
two would be ok.  Therefore, it is probably NOT the CRT or a driver on
the little board on the neck of the CRT.
</p><p>
Try turning up the SCREEN control to see if you can get a G and B raster
just to confirm that the CRT is ok.
</p><p>
Locate the video drive from the mainboard for the good and a bad color.
Interchange them and see if the problem moves.  If so, then there is
a video signal problem.  If not, it is on the little CRT board.
</p><p>
It could be a defective chroma IC or something else in the chroma decoder.

</p><h3><a name="tvdisred">Disappearing Red (or other color)</a></h3>

Problem: I have been given an old colour TV.  The reception is good, but very
often, when the contrast and brightness of the TV image is low (e.g. when
a night scene is shown), the red colour slowly disappears, leaving behind
the green and blue image and many red lines.
<p>
The remaining red retrace are the giveaway that this is most likely not
a CRT problem.
</p><p>
(If there were no red lines, it could be the filament for the red gun
of the CRT going on and off due to a bad connection inside the CRT - bad
news.)
</p><p>
How is a black and white picture?  (Turn down the color control).
</p><p>
If B/W picture is good, then the problem is somewhere back in the chroma
decoder circuitry.
</p><p>
Check the video input to the CRT video driver board and signals on that board.
If B/W picture is also bad, then you can compare red and green signals
to determine where they are becoming different.  The red lines in your
description sounds like the red video output circuit is drifting and messing
up the background level, blanking, screen, or other setting.  Could be a
capacitor or other component.

</p><h3><a name="tvwanderbb">The wandering black blob on old Sony</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I had a Sony KV-1920 TV (very old) that suddenly started to displayed
 a black blob on the screen.  The blob was anywhere from 1" around to
 almost the size of the entire screen.  It had a sharp, not fuzzy,
 outline, and it would shrink in size as the TV warmed up, usually
 disappearing completely in 30 minutes.  It shrank in sudden jumps,
 not gradually.  Sometimes the blob would be stationary, other times
 it would tumble around rapidly all over the screen."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Raymond Carlsen (rrcc@u.washington.edu).)
</p><p>
Measure the regulated +130 volt line... I think you'll find it has drifted
upwards just enough to trigger the "protective" blanking circuit. In those
sets, if the B+ (and consequently the HV) went up, the screen was
automatically blanked so you couldn't use the set. It was before HV
shutdown. Older RCA TV sets used to throw the horizontal out of sync. The
low voltage regulator is an analog type with a pass transistor that is
probably leaky, causing the high B+. Changes in line voltage and loading
(with brightness changes) cause the partially blanked picture to change
(the black blob moves around, sometimes blanking the entire screen). When
you replace the defective component, reset the 130 volts with the pot, and
you're back in business. The pot itself may have a bad spot... just move it
one way or the other to get off that spot.

</p><h3><a name="tvvbocbar">Vertical brightness or color bars</a></h3>

These are typically more or less equally spaced possibly more evident at
the left side of the screen.  They result only in brightness or color
variations, not deflection speed.  Diagonal lines are straight and not
squiggly.
<p>
Note that the appearance of these bars differs from those caused by ringing
in the deflection circuits where diagonal lines will show a squiggling
stair-step appearance.
</p><p>
The most likely cause is a dried up electrolytic capacitor in the scan derived
power supply for the video or chroma circuits or video output.  Check for this
ripple with a scope or test/replace any suspect capacitors.

<h2>Tuner, AGC, and Sync Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvmrfaoc">No reception from antenna or cable</a></h3>

Make sure your source is providing a signal and that the cable connectors
are good (center pin not broken or bent).  Try another TV if possible.
<p>
Make sure you source select switch or mode is set correctly.  Someone
may have accidentally set it to direct video or AUX input.
</p><p>
Are all bands affected?  If so, the tuner or IF is faulty.  If there is
a lot of snow, then it is probably toward the front (circuitry wise) of
the tuner.  If it is just a black screen, then it could be in the IF or
video amplifier.
</p><p>
If only certain bands are bad - channels 2-6 for example, then certain
parts of the tuner circuitry are faulty.  However, make sure the CATV
mode is set correctly as this affects reception on a band-by-band basis.
</p><p>
The problems may be due to bad solder connections of the tuner shields,
connectors, coils, and other components.  Try prodding the tuner to see
if you can make the problem come and go or at least change.

</p><h3><a name="tvpiowoon">Picture is overloaded, washed out, or noisy</a></h3>

This indicates an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) problem often caused by
a dried up capacitor.  You will probably need a schematic to go much
further.  This could be a problem in the tuner, IF, or video amplifiers.
<p>
The following assumes you are sure the signal source is strong - try a VCR or
other local one (channel 3/4, not the RCA jacks).
</p><p>
(From: Glenn Watkins (blueribb@mail.comcat.com).)
Substitute a variable voltage source for the tuner's AGC voltage. Most of the
time the range of AGC is from 1 to 7 volts.  If you can get a decent snow
free picture with an external AGC source, then the tuner is probably OK.

</p><h3><a name="tvjpows">Jumping picture on white scenes</a></h3>

This could be an AGC problem if the picture appears overloaded.  However, if
the picture is normal except unstable, the sync separate is the place to
look:
<p>
(From: Jack Schidt (jack@wintel.net).)
</p><p>
White screens are a worst case video pattern for sync separators, and will
cause an erratic shift in the vertical multivibrator trigger level unless
the horizontal and video information is filtered out [integrated] prior to
driving the vertical sync input of the processor IC.
</p><p>
This will show up with a scope as high frequency noise going into the
vertical sync input.
</p><p>
Look for a small electrolytic [in fact, all of them], around 1-10 uF or so
near the deflection/sync processor IC.  Often simply increasing the value of
this cap will help.

</p><h3><a name="tviwuvrc">Interference when using VCR RF connection</a></h3>

(Some of these comments also apply to use of LaserDisc players, satellite
receivers, video games, or other sources with RF modulator (Channel 3/4)
outputs).
<p>
This may consist of patterns or lines in the picture.
</p><p>
If this only happens on the antenna or cable, it may be a problem
with these sources or the tuner in the VCR rather than the TV.
As a test, try the connecting the TV directly to the antenna or cable.
</p><p>
If it only happens on cable, there may be a (temporary) problem with
cable transmission - contact your cable company.
</p><p>
If it happens on playback of good quality (commercial) recordings, then
it could be a compatibility problem between the VCR and TV.
</p><p>
Make sure your patch cable connections are secure and that the cables
are not damaged - in particular that the center pin is intact.
</p><p>
Try fine tuning if your TV has this capability.  If this does not
help, try switching the channel 3/4 selector on the VCR to the opposite
position and try that channel, sometimes one will be better than the other
particularly if one of these or an adjacent channel is active in your area.
</p><p>
If you have RCA baseband video inputs on your TV, try this connection to
the VCR.  These should work better in any case.
</p><p>
Confirm that it is not actually a problem with the VCR - try another TV
if possible.
</p><p>
If you just changed your component placement, the VCR or TV  may be
picking up interference from another component.  Turn off everything but
the VCR and TV and see if that identifies the culprit.  Move the TV
away from the VCR so see if they are interfering with each other - the
TV may be introducing interference into the VCR.
</p><p>
Occasionally, the particular patch cable or its length may affect
reception quality - try another one.
</p><p>
If none of this helps, you VCR's RF modulator may be bad or slightly
weak.  Alternatively, the tuner in the TV may be faulty.  If reception
is generally noisy on all sources, AGC or RF/IF alignment may need
adjusting.  However, not all tuners are created equal.  Your TV may
simply be making the best of a marginal situation.
</p><p>
A light dimmer on the same circuit as the TV may result in similar
symptoms.  If you are tuning up your motorcycle (or automobile) in the
same room, this may be spark ignition interference.

</p><p>
Probably the easiest solution is to visit your ham neighbor and
describe your difficulty.  Amateur radio operators are licensed by
federal governments (FCC) and are required as part of their examination
to demonstrate a knowledge of this type of interference.  It may well be
that the ham is not the source of the problem and even if this is the
case I'm sure he or she will be of assistance.
</p><p>
(From: Alan N. Alan, WDBJ-TV, KM4IG (alann@intrlink.com).)
</p><p>
OK, as a HAM myself, I can understand this. Channel 2 is the lowest TV channel,
right above the six meter band, 50-54 Mhz.  Channel 9 is well into VHF above
175 Mhz. It is possible that your neighbor operates 6 meters.
</p><p>
I would talk to him.  First,  the chances are it is YOUR equipment, and his
is legal and meets FCC specs.  But I would be willing to bet he will be very
cooperative to help you solve your interference.
</p><p>
The thing to do is talk to him, calmly, and tell him about your problem.  Then,
schedule a time where he can transmit his gear and see if your problem exists
along with his transmissions.. If it does, you can go from there.  Many ham
clubs have many engineers and radio and TV people in their memberships that
will jump in and help you solve your problem.  Again, he is probably legal,
and consumer equipment is not known for it's RF resistance.  Consumer
manufacturers cut corners wherever they can.  This includes filtering and
design.

<p>
If you still cannot eliminate the hum, try building a simple "ground isolator"
out of two 75-300 ohm baluns, as described in the link below:

Place it as close to the TV as possible.

</p><p>
This seems like a cable company problem, but you need to prove it to the cable
guy before he will start climbing pole's and changing amps and couplers
looking for an intermittent amp. (And I don't blame him.)
</p><p>
At the main cable line to the house and remove all couplers and put a single
line from the cable direct to the rf input on a single TV, then watch it for a
few of days.  If the problem re-occurs call the cable guy and show him what
you have done and explain the problem again.
</p><p>
Put yourself in the shoes of the cable guy.  He comes into a house with VCR's
and all the gadgets we all have hooked up to our TV's with lines running all
over the house, and can't get to the back of the TV to see what's there, and
he's not a TV repair guy anyway and nobody else in the neighborhood is
complaining and this problem may happen when it rains but it may not. mmmhhh
</p><p>
If it does not show up on the single TV, then the problem is probably yours.
Add one device at a time until you find the trouble maker.  Start with the
your Cable AMPLIFIER.
</p><p>
(From: 4real (alan69@iname.com).)
</p><p>
You eliminate all of the other junk attached between your main cable input to
your house and your TV to be sure it isn't the cause.
</p><p>
You will definitely want to suspect a problem with the amplifier you have
installed.  Especially if it is one of those cheap ones.  Usually when the
filter capacitor in an amplifier goes bad it will cause the hum bars you are
describing, and they can be intermittent.  Another problem may be that you
have too much signal going into the amplifier.  Amps are rated to handle a
certain amount of input signal (measured in db) depending on the number of
channels you wish to amplify, and the gain provided by the amp.  If you try to
feed an amplifier with too much signal it will overdrive it and cause a
venetian blind, or herringbone effect.  It could also be possible that the
cable company is supplying a signal with reverse tilt.  That means more signal
on the lower channels and less on the higher ones.  The lower channels might
be the ones overdriving the amplifier.  The only way to tell for sure is to
measure it with a signal level meter.  (very expensive unless you happen to be
in the business and have one handy) If this is the case (too much signal going
in) you probably don't need the amplifier to feed only 2 TVs.
</p><p>
The last thing I can think of and the cable guy should have checked this: They
use 60 VAC on their main trunk lines to power their line amplifiers.  The taps
which feed the individual houses are supposed to prevent this ac from going to
the individual lines.  Occasionally one of these devices fails or a line guy
forgets to pull a fuse and hence the ac gets sent to your TV.  It won't
necessarily fry your TV but can cause problems.  It may even damage the TV
tuners that are connected to that feed.  In most cases if you touch the center
conductor of the cable and a good ground you can feel the ac.  It isn't enough
to hurt you but you will definitely know it's there.  To be on the safe side
you should test it with a volt meter.
</p><p>
(From: Cliff R. (craeihl1@nycap.rr.com).)
</p><p>
My guess would be your cable amplifier. The fact that you see TWO bars on your
screen tells me that it's 120 Hz interference - the frequency caused by ailing
full wave power supplies used in these amps. Take the amp out of the line for
a few days. If you don't have "snow" in the picture with it out, s...can it!
If you find it was bad and can't live without it, you might try making sure
all your internal cable, splitters, and connections are good quality &amp; in good
shape. Radio Shack stuff......well, it stinks!  You can purchase primo
splitters &amp; cable from your cable company and its not that
expensive. Certainly cheaper than an amp (which you might not need if the
cabling were up to snuff).
</p><p>
You could also cry to the cable company for more signal into your house.  This
may or may not work but it's worth a shot.
</p><p>
I would put an amp in line only as a LAST resort. Most of the inexpensive
amps sold are......cheap. They can easily cause more trouble than they cure.
If you must, go with a primo unit from Blonder-Tongue or Jerrold.
</p><p>
(From: Charles Hope (charles.hope@argonet.co.uk).)
</p><p>
It sounds very like a problem that I had and solved.  
</p><p>
Cause: Modern TV sets antenna connector does not have true earth on the
screen but is at a potential of half mains supply.  It is possible to draw
about 30 micro-amps from this.  
</p><p>
Hum bars are induced in the amplifier because there is a small resistance in
the earth path between output and input giving about 1 volt drop of this
stray mains signal.  Worse when raining because the cable ground is better
then.
</p><p>
Solution:  Either ground the antenna screen or fit a "braid breaker" in the
screen.

</p><h3><a name="tvmoncbc">Missing or noisy channel or block of channels</a></h3>

If you are unable to receive certain channels or blocks of channels,
this is a tuner problem - could be as simple as bad connections - or
even simpler:.
<p>
First, check to see that the tuning mode is correct - TV, CATV, as
this is the most common cause of channels 'disappearing'.
</p><p>
TV channels are assigned frequencies ranging from 72 to almost 800 MHz
depending on broadcast or cable channel assignment.  To tune over such a
wide range requires splitting it up into various bands even if these are
not actually defined.  If you have a varactor tuned set, then you already
know about the Vl, Vh, and U bands which may use separate front-end
components.  Even modern quartz PLL synthesized tuners need to allocate
circuitry depending on frequency range.  Therefore, if a block channels is
not working, it could be due to a failure of some component related to that
frequency range.  Aside from looking for bad connections, resoldering the
shields and connector pins, prodding, pressing, praying, etc. you will need
a schematic to have any chance of finding such a fault.
</p><p>
There is another slight possibility.  Some TVs have a parental lockout
capability (pre V-chip) to prevent kids or other unauthorized access to
selected channels.  The channel selections may have been accidentally
altered.  Check your user manual for instructions on programming this
feature.  Even on models without this option, the same internal circuitry
could be present but not normally accessible.  A power surge or stray cosmic
ray could have put the set in a screwy mode.  Unplugging power for a minute or 
probably a much longer time might possibly reset such an anomaly.

</p><h3><a name="tvlocaw">Loss of Channel after Warmup</a></h3>

If there is a general loss of picture and sound but there is light on the
screen, then most likely the tuner or IF stage is pooping out.
<p>
With both no sound and no picture but a raster and static, it is most
likely a problem in the tuner, power to the tuner, or its controller
(if non-knob type).
</p><p>
If it recovers after being off for a while, then you need to try a cold
spray in the tuner/controller to identify the component that is failing.
Take appropriate safety precautions while working in there!
</p><p>
If it stays broken, then most likely some component in the tuner, its
controller, or its power supply as failed. There is a slight chance that
it could be a bad solder connection - I have seen these in the tuner modules
of RCAs on several occasions (and many other manufacturers - apparently
not a solved manufacturing problem even after 40+ years!

</p><h3><a name="tvctdaswu">Channel tuning drifts as set warms up</a></h3>

This may be a slight drift - like someone is messing with the fine tuning
or such a substantial change in tuning frequency that the channels go by
as though you are surfing.
<p>
Possible causes depend on tuner type:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Quartz tuner (10 button direct access digital synthesizer) - For a
 slight drift, a component is probably changing value, possibly the
 crystal in the reference oscillator.  For gross changes - flipping
 through channels - it is more likely to be a digital control problem -
 the microcontroller is misdirecting the synthesizer to change frequency.
<p>
</p></li><li>Varactor tuner (buttons but not direct channel access) - If only a
 single pushbutton selection is the problem, the the varactor tuning diode
 for that button is probably changing capacitance.  If all channels in
 a band (Vl, Vh, U) are having a problem, it is more likely to be a
 drifting D/A or faulty AFT (Automatic Fine Tuning) circuit or power supply.
<p>
</p></li><li>Turret or switch tuner (Knobs) - A component like a capacitor is changing
 value.
</li></ol>
<p>
You will have to get in there with a heat gun or cold spray and track it down
the old fashioned way.  At least, the problem is almost certainly localized
to the tuner box (and possibly the controller if applicable).
</p><p>
As noted, gradual slight changes in tuning are likely due to frequency
determining components drifting.
</p><p>
Uncontrolled channel surfing is probably a logic problem.   For the
quartz tuner, this could still be marginal connections causing the
microprocessor to misdirect the synthesizer to change channels.
</p><p>
For the latter case, particularly, the cause may still be bad connections
resulting in loss of channel memory and/or erratic behavior.

</p><h3><a name="tvnipasdbs">Noise in picture and sound due to bright scene</a></h3>

When a bright scene comes, the screen flashes and there is a lot
of noise in the sound.  When a dark scene comes, there is no 
flash or noise.  Changing channel does not help.  The noise 
persists even when the sound is muted.
<p>
(The following is from: Lattuca@Midwest.net (Sam Lattuca))
</p><p>
When the video detector level is adjusted too high, you will get noise in 
the sound while screen contains a lot of white information (i.e. letters) but 
won't when only dark scenes are present. The video level adjust is usually a 
small coil normally located near the IF section. Since your set is several 
years old, this wouldn't be uncommon. It can be adjusted while watching the 
picture and listening to the sound.

</p><h3><a name="tviispsdc">Internal interference - switchmode power supplies and digital circuitry</a></h3>

(From: Mr. Caldwell (jcaldwel@iquest.net).)
<p>
On virtually all newer televisions and in particular Mitsubishi televisions
there is a problem with interference being emitted by the switched mode power
supply.
</p><p>
The common symptom of this 'fault' is snake like dotted 'S' lines on channels
2-6. It doesn't matter if it's cable, antenna or satellite(channel 3/4), this
symptom can occur.
</p><p>
The common cause of this interference being allowed into the tuner is cabling.
The super cheap 'suitable for garbage tie' cable that comes with even the most
expensive VCR's is the culprit in most cases. The second is a set of rabbit
ears the least common is an open or high resistance to ground connection
(usually at a connector) on the incoming cable line.
</p><p>
To fix this there is only one reliable solution. All cabling must be hand made
RG-6 cable. Make as follows: 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Strip the outer sheath of the cable to expose the braid and *fold the braid*
 away from the end so that it covers the unstripped outer braid. 
<p>
</p></li><li>Strip the inner conductor to it's proper length.
<p>
</p></li><li>Install a good quality RG-6 connector *over the folded* braid.
<p>
</p></li><li>Crimp with the proper RG-6 attachment to the cable crimpers, don't use a
 set of pliers or other -crushing- device.
</li></ol>
<p>
If the cable company doesn't waterproof the outside connectors, Radio Shack
sells a 'sealing tape' just for this purpose. Most cable companies use self 
sealing 'o-ring' connectors.  
</p><p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
There is also interference from internal microprocessors and digital
text generators (on-screen display, close captioning, teletext).
And with 100 Hz digital television there is a wealth of sources ...
</p><p>
Using only high quality shielded cable as described above seems like really
good advise, FWIW I'd like to second that.  I wish that everyone would take
antenna cables as seriously as you.
</p><p>
Generally, double-braided cable (using copper foil for second shield) and
coaxially constructed connectors are recommended.  But I think that the
hand-mountable F-type connectors (Radio Shack) would be equally good, though
less robust, if mounted properly.
</p><p>
As far as antennas go, a decent rooftop antenna should always be better than
whatever rabbit ear construction you might think of. In this case, distance
counts too, the antenna WILL pick up interference.

</p><h3><a name="tvtdrabear">Those darn rabbit ears</a></h3>

So you bought a high performance TV and a set of $20.00 rabbit ears and there
are lines on channels 2 to 6. Go buy a set of rabbit ears that has *only* a coax
connector on the back, throw the cable supplied with it in the bin for 'twist
ties'.  Also buy an inexpensive surge suppressor that has a cable protector,
enough RG-6 cable and connectors for two cables.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make one cable long enough to get the antenna away from the set (12ft) and
 the other to connect the antenna to the surge suppressor.
<p>
</p></li><li>Connect the long cable to the set and the other end to the surge suppressor.
<p>
</p></li><li>Find an outlet away from the set and plug the surge suppressor in (pick the
 most sane order for all of this.)
<p>
</p></li><li>Connect the shorter cable to the surge suppressor and connect the other end
 to the antenna.
</li></ul>
<p>
You're done and if you thought carefully you would have put the antenna near
your easy chair so you can adjust the picture or put the antenna where you'll
get the best reception and prevent interference. The surge suppressor was
needed to ground the other end of the coax so as not to make the outer shield
an antenna for the interference from the TV's power supply. This method can
also help allevate 'dead spots' when using rabbit ears.

</p><h3><a name="tvherring">Herringbone lines in picture</a></h3>

(From: Isaac Bergen (isaac.bergen@sympatico.ca).)
<p>
Could be interference. If the pattern slowly moves up the screen, the 
problem is from the 60 Hz power. A line of dots or thin lines usually 
means corona discharge (arcing) from a nearby power line (especially on 
humid days). Could also be from a bad filter capacitor in the TV's power 
supply. A "checkered" pattern could be from a digital type noise source 
like a computer, etc. If you move the TV to another room and the 
interference changes, that's probably it.

</p><h3><a name="tvemrfihell">EM or RFI hell?</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"About a mile from my home there are four TV (channels 2, 4, 9 and 14) and
 several broadcast FM transmitters, all working with powers in the 100+ Kw
 ERP class.
<p>
 Radio reception is a nightmare, mostly (I think) because of IM products
 in overloaded front end stages. In most bands there are several regions
 at a spacing of about 100 Khz, each 30 to 40 Khz wide with a harsh buzz
 stronger than anything else."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (don@Misty.com).)
</p><p>
If the buzz is of a frequency like the power line frequency or a
harmonic thereof, then the nearby transmitters may not be the culprit.
Instead, nearby corona on a high voltage power line, a nearby neon sign,
or a nearby light dimmer may be the offender.  Although the noise from
these is usually broad-band, the noise could get concentrated into bands
spaced 100 kHz apart if something resonant around 100 kHz is involved in
the noise production.
</p><p>
I would try temporarily turning off all fluorescent lights, neon signs,
lights with dimmers, etc. and asking your neighbors to do the same to see
if any of these is the offender.  I have often found light dimmers to be
major RF noise sources.
</p><p>
Possibly, an RF noise filter for the AC power for your receiver may help
things.  If you isolate a single offending appliance, it may help to plug
it into an RF noise filter.  If you use any filters with either the
offending appliance or the receiver, try all combinations of plug reversal
to see what works best.  Both leads of any offending appliance may not
equally spew noise, and both lines in the filter may not equally block
noise.  Both lines of the receiver's power cord may not equally bring
noise into the receiver, if this is the route the noise takes.

<h2>Audio Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvpfnaud">Picture fine, no audio</a></h3>

First check that any muting control is not activated.  This might be
a button on the remote or set itself.  If you have a headphone jack, it
may have dirty contacts as plugging in a headphone usually mutes
the speaker.
<p>
If the set is mono or only one channel of a stereo set is out, then
check for bad connections to the loudspeaker.  Test the loudspeaker by
disconnecting one of the wires (with the power off!) and measuring its
resistance with an ohmmeter (it should be less than 100 ohms - probably
less than 8 ohms).  Or momentarily touch a 1.5 volt battery to the speaker
terminals - you should get a click or pop from the speaker.
</p><p>
Next, trace back from the speaker output terminals to the circuit board
and look for bad solder connections or a loose or dirty connector.
</p><p>
If these tests do not reveal anything, you probably need a scope (or
audio signal tracer) and schematic.   Or at least the part number off of
the chip.  Is the final amp a chip also or just a transistor?  Have you
tested the transistor?  If there is little or no buzz from the speaker,
that would indicate a problem fairly near the output.  If the tuner/if were
bad, I would expect some noise/humm pickup from the low level audio stages.
Get the part number off of the chip. If it is in a socket, check the
contacts for corrosion or looseness.

</p><h3><a name="tvwodaud">Weak or distorted audio</a></h3>

Assuming you are not attempting to play it at ear shattering levels,
this may be due to an alignment problem in the IF/audio demodulator,
a bad audio IC or other circuitry, bad connection, or a defective speaker.
<p>
If your TV has an earphone or audio line out jack, try this to see if it
is clear.  If so, then your problem is in the final audio amp or speaker(s).
</p><p>
If only one channel of a stereo TV is affected, it is almost certainly the
audio amp or speaker for that channel.  Interchange connection to the two
speakers temporarily and see if the problem moves.
</p><p>
If the problem is at all intermittent - try gently whacking the TV - then
it is likely a bad connection - either a cold solder joint or a dirty
or tired IC socket.
</p><p>
The audio amplifiers in newer TVs are almost always ICs and replacements
are usually readily available.  If the IC is in a socket, remove the IC,
clean the pins and socket contacts and reinstall it.  Sometimes, the contacts
on old socket lose their springiness and do not provide solid connections.
Such a socket will need to be replaced.
</p><p>
If the set uses discrete transistors, it s also possible for one of these
to become noisy.
</p><p>
If your TV is fairly old - 10 years or so - this may be an alignment problem
requiring tweaking of a coil in the sound IF.  See your service manual.
It may be possible to have similar problems with newer TVs but this is
relatively rare.
</p><p>
There could also be bad electrolytic capacitors, probably in the power supply
area.  Even though you might think this would result in hum and there is none
(even when there is no audio in the program or the sound is turned down) dried
up caps can result in distorted sound that may sound like a sort of clipping.
An ESR meter is best for testing (with power off!) but carefully jumpering
known good caps across suspect ones (again with power off, then turn on the
set and check), will eventually find the bad one(s).

</p><h3><a name="tvbuzzing">Buzzing TV</a></h3>

Do you actually mean buzz - low frequency as in 60 Hz?  Or, do you really mean
high pitched whine.  If the latter, see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvwhine">High pitched whine or squeal from TV with no other
symptoms</a>.  Or, it may be a combination of both
effects.  Is the buzz through the speaker or from the inside of the set?
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If it is the speaker, then it is a problem with the audio circuitry.  This
 could be a design issue - very common or an actual fault (if it wasn't there
 before).  It could also be interference caused by fluorescent lights or
 appliances like vacuum cleaners with universal motors or body massagers with
 vibrator interrupters (which generate sparks).
<p>
 Where the source of the problem cannot be located or eliminated, consider
 using a (HiFi) VCR for the tuner with an external stereo amplifier and the
 disable the internal speaker.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>There is a slight possibility that the AC power in your house has some
 harmonic content - the waveform is not sinusoidal.  This might be the case
 if you try to run on the same circuit as an active dimmer or something else
 with thyristor control.  Proximity to heavy industry could also cause this.
<p>
 Relocating the offending device to another branch circuit may help.  You
 could also try a line conditioner (not just surge suppressor) which includes
 filtering.  Or, use a HiFi VCR as your audio source (see above).  Else,
 petition to have that metal foundry move out of the neighborhood :-).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>However, a buzzing that only occurs when the picture has sharply defined
 text or graphics, may be an overload problem at the source - some TVs
 simply handle it better than others.
<p>
 If it is a fault in the TV, an adjustment to the tuner or IF may be needed.
</p><p>
 (From: Paul Weber (webpa@aol.com).)
</p><p>
 Not to disparage proponents of the evil demon theory, but the phenomenon is
 more commonly known as "sync buzz".  It is caused by poor performance in the
 TV's audio circuitry.  It can usually be fixed by (1) reducing the signal
 strength and/or (2) tweaking the sound IF coil.  Unfortunately, some of the
 latest TV receivers have no sound IF coil to adjust.  If your TV has a sound
 IF coil, it can be done by ear, if you don't care about sound quality.
 However,I'd recommend taking it so a competent shop and describing the
 symptoms.  Use the term "sync buzz in the audio," and they'll know what you
 mean.  Be advised that it can't be cured in some TVs due to poor design.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If it is from inside the set (and not from the speaker), it is in the
 deflection (probably vertical) or power supply.  Either of these can vary
 in severity with picture content due to the differing current requirements
 based on brightness.  It could be a power supply transformer, deflection
 yoke, or other magnetic component.  Even ferrite beads have been caught
 buzzing when no one was looking :-).  Any of these parts could vibrate if
 not anchored securely or as they loosen up with age.
<p>
 On TVs that can be switched to "letterbox" mode, a reduction in the intensity
 of the buzz would help to confirm this diagnosis since the amplitude of
 the vertical deflection is smaller.
</p><p>
 Some hot-melt glue, RTV silicone, or even a strategically wedged toothpick
 may help.  A new part may or may not quiet it down - the replacement could
 be worse!
</p><p>
 See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvreyoken">Reducing/eliminating yoke noise</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Some TVs are simply poorly designed.  You cannot infer the severity of this
 annoyance from any specifications available to the consumer.  It is strictly
 a design (e.g. cost) issue.  The size of the TV is not a strong indicator of
 the severity of the problem but there will be some relationship as the power
 levels are higher for larger sets.  The best you can do is audition various
 TVs very carefully to find one that you are satisfied with.
</li></ul>
<p>
BTW, when I got my new super-duper RCA Colortrak in 1980, it had a similar
annoying buzz - even had a repair guy out who behaved as though this was to
be expected.  I did get used to it and am not even aware of it today - and
still use that set.
</p><p>
Additional comments:
</p><p>
(From: Karen (kclark9835@aol.com).)
</p><p>
Also for some audio buzz problems especially in the older units don't overlook
the possibility of a misaligned trap. or a touch-up of the sound discriminator
may prove helpful.
</p><p>
(From: Alan (algba@ix.netcom.com).)
</p><p>
If the buzz is coming from the speaker suspect a bad saw filter in the if
circuit (very common).
</p><p>
If it is coming from elsewhere in the set it could be the flyback transformer,
line input choke, or most common on those sets - the deflection yoke.  I have
repaired many of these yoke by using a wooden shim and some silicone rubber.
In the collar of the yoke just ahead of the lock down clamp, there are some
metal strips under the plastic.  These are magnet that are used for convergence
correction at the top and bottom of the picture.  If you disturb them too much
it will throw off the convergence.

</p><h3><a name="tvchatyoke">Chattering yoke</a></h3>

This is a special case of buzzing originating from the deflection yoke.
<p>
(From: John Del (ohger1@aol.com).)
</p><p>
I am assuming your talking about a NAP yoke made by Panasonic/Quasar also used
by them as well. The vibration comess from the metal shunt inside the yoke
which is used for "self convergence".  The shunts were held by a mastic
material that breaks down into a powdery substance.
</p><p>
Remove the yoke from the tube and bore a small hole in the plastic on both
halves (top and bottom).  These holes will be at the 12 and 6 positions, as
the 3 and 9 will have windings visible.  Fill the holes with white glue and
let the glue settle in, rotating the yoke as it does.  The glue will soak into
the powdery material and harden it. You will have to do this several times
until the glue oozes out near the clamp. Give it a full day to dry. This is
better than paying $60 to $80 for the yoke.

</p><h3><a name="tvwhine">High pitched whine or squeal from TV with no other symptoms</a></h3>

First, make sure it is not coming from the loudspeaker itself.  If it is,
then we are looking at an unusual electronic interference problem rather
than simply mechanical vibration.
<p>
If it is a new set and think the sounds will drive you insane, returning it
for a refund or replacement may be best alternative.  However, you may get
used to it in time.  I don't know about returning a set to a store that
doesn't take refunds (I won't even ask about that!).
</p><p>
In most cases, this sound, while annoying, does not indicate an impending
failure (at least not to the set - perhaps to your mental health) or signify
anything about the expected reliability of the set though this is not always
the case.  Intermittent or poor connections in the deflection or power supply
subsystems can also result in similar sounds.  However, it is more likely that
some part is just vibrating in response to a high frequency electric current.
</p><p>
There are several parts inside the TV that can potentially make this noise.
These include the horizontal flyback transformer, deflection yoke, other
transformers, even ferrite beads in the horizontal deflection circuits.  In
addition, transformers or chokes in the switching power supply if this is
distinct from the horizontal deflection circuitry.  Or even a portion of the
sheetmetal used for shielding if in close proximity to a magnetic component.
</p><p>
You have several options before resorting to a 12 pound hammer:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>As much as you would like to dunk the TV in sound deadening insulation,
 this should be avoided as it will interfere with with proper cooling.
 However, the interior of the entertainment center cabinet can be lined with
 a non-flammable sound absorbing material, perhaps acoustic ceiling tiles.
 Hopefully, not a lot of sound energy is coming from the front of the set.
<p>
</p></li><li>Move the TV out of a corner if that is where it is located - the corner
 will focus sound energy into the room.
<p>
</p></li><li>Anything soft like carpeting, drapes, etc. will do a good job of absorbing
 sound energy in this band.  Here is your justification for purchasing those
 antique Persian rugs you always wanted :-).
</li></ul>
<p>
If you are desperate and want to check the inside of the set:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Using appropriate safety precautions, you can try prodding the various
 suspect parts (flyback, deflection yoke, other transformers), even lowly
 ferrite beads, with an insulated tool such as a dry wooden stick.  Listen
 through a cardboard tube to try to localizing the source.  If the sounds
 changes, you know what part to go after.
<p>
</p></li><li>Once you have located the guilty party, some careful repositioning, a
 strategically wedged wooden toothpick, or a dab of RTV silicone or hot-melt
 glue may keep it quiet.  Where the yoke is the guilty party, see the
 section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvreyoken">Reducing/eliminating yoke noise</a>.
<p>
</p></li><li>It is possible to coat the flyback transformer, but this is used mostly
 when there a loose core or windings and you are getting not only the
 15,735 Hz horizontal (NTSC) but also various subharmonics of this.   This is
 probably acceptable but may increase the temperature of the flyback.
<p>
</p></li><li>A replacement flyback (or whatever part) may cure the problem unless it is a
 design flaw or manufacturing quality problem.  However, the replacement part
 could be noisier.  You really do not want to replace the yoke (aside from the
 cost) as convergence and other service adjustments would need to be
 performed.  Other transformers can be replaced.
</li></ul>
<p>
Note that the deflection frequency - just over 15 kHz for NTSC and PAL - is
on the border of audible for adults but will likely be loud to younger people
possibly to the point of being terribly annoying - or worse.  If you are
over 40 (men more so than women), you may not be able to hear the fundamental
at all (at least you can look forward to silence in the future!).  So, even
sending the TV back for repair may be hopeless if the technician cannot
hear what you are complaining about!
</p><p>
BTW, if you have a really old tube type TV, the power tubes (damper and
horizontal output) can also whine but these sets are few and far between
these days :-).

</p><h3><a name="tvreyoken">Reducing/eliminating yoke noise</a></h3>

(From: Terry DeWick (dewickt@esper.com).)
<p>
Carefully look under vertical core next to plastic liner, on top and bottom is
a plate called the astigmatism shunt, it has come loose.  Work RTV, epoxy, or
service cement onto it to glue it down and noise should quit.
</p><p>
(From: TVman (tvman@newwave.net).)
</p><p>
I have fixed a total of 27 of these sets with noisy yokes by removing the
yokes and using motor armature spray sealant.
</p><p>
If you carefully mark the EXACT position of everything (yoke, purity magnets),
and slide the yoke off the CRT, then once the yoke has been sealed with motor
armature spray sealant and has dried thoroughly, put the yoke back EXACTLY
where it was, there should be no problems.
</p><p>
The only thing I have had to do was set the purity on one set, but it
was off a little to begin with.

</p><h3><a name="tvwhinewo">Whining when off?</a></h3>

Many TVs actually run their switchmode power supplies even when off to power
the standby stuff like the remote control receiver, real time clock or timer,
and channel memory.  Depending on the design of the regulator, the power supply
may be running at a low chopper frequency due to the light load.  Some people,
dogs, and rodents are then annoyed.  It could also be an indication of a
fault like a bad capacitor or loosened transformer core if this symptom just
developed - your hearing isn't likely improving :-(.
<p>
There is so much running nowadays in 'off' electronics!

<h2>Miscellaneous Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvgerrbeh">General erratic behavior</a></h3>

You press VOLUME UP and the channel changes or a setup menu appears all by
itself just at the climax of your mystery story.
<p>
Before you break out the screwdriver (or 12 pound hammer), cover up the
IR remote sensor.  Some types of electronic ballasted fluorescent lights
may confuse the remote control receiver.  Someone or something may be
sitting on the remote hand unit or it may be defective and continuously
issuing a bad command.  Or, the kids across the street may have nothing
better to do than to drive your TV (and you) nuts with their remote!
</p><p>
There is also a slight chance power line interference (from a light dimmer
or external sources) may result in similar symptoms.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvwtrint">Wiring transmitted interference</a>.
</p><p>
Assuming this is not the source of the problem:
</p><p>
Check for bad connections - see if gently whacking the TV makes any
difference or triggers the errant behavior.  Bad connections in the power
supply, system controller, or tuner, may result in this sort of behavior.
See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvtmmqcs">TV and monitor manufacturing quality
and cold solder joints</a>.  See the sections and separate documents on
problems with RCA/GE/Proscan and Sony TVs if yours is made by one of these
companies.
</p><p>
A microcontroller or other electronic problem is also possible.  If the
symptoms only develop after the set warms up, it may be heat related (though
simple bad connections are more likely).  Use 'circuit chiller' or a heat gun
to identify the bad part.

</p><h3><a name="tvwtrint">Wiring transmitted interference</a></h3>

The power that comes from the wall outlet is supposed to be a nice sinusoid
at 60 Hz (in the U.S.) and it probably is coming out of the power plant.
However, equipment using electric motors (e.g., vacuum cleaners), fluorescent
lamps, lamp dimmers or motor speed controls (shop tools), and other high power
devices, may result in a variety of effects.
<p>
While TVs normally include some line filtering, the noise immunity varies.
Therefore, if the waveform is distorted enough, some effects may show up even
on a high quality TV.
</p><p>
Symptoms will usually be one or two areas of noise moving slowly up the screen.
</p><p>
The source is probably local - in your house and probably on the same branch
circuit - but could also be several miles away.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The rate will be the difference between the power line frequency (60 Hz in
 the U.S.) and the scan rate (59.94 Hz for NTSC).  This results in a drift of
 about 16 seconds for a complete cycle (8 seconds if the inteference is at
 120 Hz).
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>A single bar would indicate interference at the power line frequency.
<p>
 </p></li><li>A pair of bars would indicate interference at twice the power line
  frequency.
 </li></ul>
<p>
 Either of these are possible.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Try to locate the problem device by turning off all suspect equipment to see
 if the problem disappears.
<p>
</p></li><li>The best solution is to replace or repair the offending device.  In the
 case of a light dimmer, for example, models are available that do a better
 job of suppressing interference than the typical $3 home center special.
 Appliances are supposed to include adequate noise suppression but this is
 not always the case.
<p>
 If the source is in the next county, this option presents some significant
 difficulties :-).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Plugging the TV into another outlet may isolate it from the offending device
 enough to eliminate or greatly reduce the interference.
<p>
</p></li><li>The use of a line filter may help.  A surge suppressor is NOT a line filter.
<p>
</p></li><li>Similar symptoms could also be produced by a defective power supply in the
 TV or other fault.  The surest way of eliminating this possibility is to try
 the TV at another location.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvjitflkdpa">Jittering or flickering due to problems with AC power</a></h3>

If you have eliminated other possibilities such as electromagnetic
interference from nearby equipment or a faulty video cable or problems
with the video input (e.g., cable or VCR) - then noisy or fluctuating AC
power may be a possibility.  However, most modern TVs usually have well
regulated power supplies so this is less common than it used to be.  Then
again, your TV may just be overly sensitive.  It is also possible that
some fault in its power supply regulator has resulted in it becoming more
sensitive to small power fluctuations that are unavoidable.
<p>
One way to determine if the problem is likely to be related to AC power
is to run the TV on clean power in the same location connected to the
same video input.  For example, running it on an Uninterruptible Power Source
(UPS) with the line cord pulled from the wall socket would be an excellent
test.  The output of the UPS's inverter should be free of any power line
noise.  If the TV's image has now settled down: 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Large appliances like air conditioners, refrigerator, or washing machines
 on the same circuit might cause significant power dips and spikes as they
 cycle.
<p>
 Plugging a table lamp into the same outlet may permit you to see any obvious
 fluctuations in power.  What else is on the same circuit?  Depending on
 how your house or apartment is wired, the same feed from the service panel
 may be supplying power to widely separated areas.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>For some unfathomable reason, your TV may just be more sensitive to
 something about the power from the circuit in that room.  There may be
 nothing actually wrong, just different.  While unlikely, a light dimmer
 on the same circuit could be producing line-conducted interference.
<p>
 If you have a multimeter, you could at least compare the voltages
 between the location where it has problems and the one where it is
 happy.  Perhaps, the TV is sensitive to being on a slightly
 different voltage.  This might only be a problem if some circuitry
 in the the TV is marginal in some respect to begin with, however.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>There could be a bad connection somewhere on the circuit.  If your house
 has aluminum wiring, this is a definite possibility.
<p>
 Try a table lamp since its brightness should fluctuate as well.  This
 should be checked out by a competent electrician as it represents a real
 fire hazard.
</p></li></ol>
<p>
An electrician may be able to pinpoint the cause but many do not have
the training or experience to deal with problems of this sort.  Certainly,
if you find any power line fluctuations not accounted for by major
appliances, on the same circuit this should be checked by an electrician.

</p><h3><a name="tvbftbav">TV blows fuses or trips breakers or worse when A/V connections are made</a></h3>

You have sent the TV for repair and now three times, it blows something
the instant anything is connected to it in your house.  Other A/V equipment
operates fine.
<p>
Assuming all the other stuff is plugged into the same outlet asn is 115 VAC
equipment and that thsi happens instantly when the TV is connected:
</p><p>
Next time they bring it back, measure the voltage between the A/V connector
shields and the shields on your cables - I wouldn't be surprised to find some
substantial fraction of 115 VAC between them.  This would mean that there is
an internal short in the TV (their problem - any competent service center will
routinely check for signal-AC ground shorts) resulting in a connection between
the non-isolated AC ground and the signal ground.  When you connect your
equipment, you complete a path which results in a short circuit.  Depending
on the design of the TV and where the fault lies, much more than a simple
fuse may be destroyed.  This is similar to connecting a scope probe ground
to a live chassis TV - see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsafg">Safety guidelines</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvshakes">My TV has the shakes</a></h3>

You turn on your TV and 5-10 seconds later, the display is shaking or
vibrating for a second or so.  It used to only occur when first turned on,
but now, the problem occurs 3 times in 30 seconds.   Of course, many
variations on this general theme are possible.
<p>
Some possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>External interference - did you change anything or move your A/V setup
 recently?  Do you have a computer monitor nearby?
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective circuitry in TV - power supply regulation, deflection,
 or bad internal connections are possible.
<p>
</p></li><li>Defective video cable (unlikely) - wiggle the cables to be see if
 you can induce the problem.
<p>
</p></li><li>Loose trim magnets of other magnetic components on or near deflection yoke.
 This is somewhat rare but if the adhesive comes apart, the magnetic fields
 from the deflection current can cause the parts to vibrate which will
 result in a jitter or movement of the picture.  There may even be audible
 crackling or snapping sounds associated with this vibration.
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that many of the sources of electromagnetic interference that are
problems with computer monitors like transformers and power lines will
not cause noticeable shaking, wiggling, or jiggling on a TV because the
power line and vertical scan are at almost exactly the same frequency
and any such movement would be very slow.

</p><h3><a name="tvblkbox">TV displays black box with normal picture border</a></h3>

When the set is first turned on, it works fine for about 20-30 seconds, then
the picture goes away - all but about 1 inch of picture all around the outer
edge of the screen.  The square ring of picture that is left, is dim but
otherwise normal.
<p>
(The following from: (jack haney) jhaney@pacifier.com))
</p><p>
If this is a newer set, this sounds very much like a "closed 
caption" box for a captioning system not being used in your area.
Newer Mitsubishis do much the same thing.  If the wrong caption type
is selected inadvertantly, all you'll see is a large black box
on screen taking up about all but an inch each way.  Try turning off
all closed caption.  The first time I saw this I looked like a damn
fool in front of a customer, took me 30 minutes to figure it out.
</p><p>
(From: Sam.)
</p><p>
If this doesn't help, power down completely by pulling the plug for a few
minutes.  That may reset the TV's microbrain.  Else, there may actually be
a failure of the circuitry that selects the closed caption.  In that case,
the TV will need repair.

</p><h3><a name="tvadvover">Advertising overload</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I noted the advertsing programs put in bright several frames of overshooting
 white signals in purpose of attracting attention which I do not want also it
 gets on my nerves sometimes.  *flash*  *flash*  Ughhh!  Is there a way to
 cutoff the "overload" or tone down that?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
Technically, the TV takes care of its own overload protection.  Or at least it
*should*, on some TV's you will certainly observe the line transformer going
into saturation for a while.  Other than that there is not much you can do,
each TV should represent its input signals with as much fidelity as possible.
Change channels?
</p><p>
(I already suggested not watching. :-) --- Sam.)

</p><h3><a name="tvstrcodes">Strange codes appearing on TV screen</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I've seen this sort of thing on a TV I bought a couple of years ago. I
 only see it when Proctor &amp; Gamble ads are on.
<p>
 The newer TVs are required to have Closed Caption decoding (CCD). My TV
 has an OFF-ON button for CCD. It also has a button labeled CH1-CH2. When
 pushed in I get the verbal text on the screen like I should. When the
 button is out, I get the funny codes from Proctor &amp; Gamble."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(From: Tim (jollyrgr@mc.net).)
</p><p>
The code you are seeing is Closed Caption 2.  My Zenith has CC 1, 2, 3, 4,
as well as Text 1, 2, 3, and 4.  I have seen CC 1 which is the normal closed
captions.  CC 2 is used for commercial logging/identification.  There should
be a way to completely turn off the captions.  The TV, as you state, has a
switch for turning off the captions and should solve your problem.

 Turn the set back on and it should be back to normal.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>For Sanyo TVs:
<p>
 (From: Bill A. (Lucy27@ix.netcom.com).)
</p><p>
 Try pressing the "menu" button on the unit and keep it depressed for about
 15 to 20 seconds.  This should release the demo mode.
</p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="tvrainedon">TV was rained on</a></h3>

Was the set plugged in when the leak started?  Any piece of equipment with
remote power-on capability has some portions live at all times when plugged
in and so there may have been damage due to short circuits etc.  Substantial
damage could be done due to short circuits.
<p>
Otherwise, you may just need to give it more time to dry out.  I have
had devices with keypads getting wet that required more than a week but
then were fine.   There are all kinds of places for water to be trapped and
take a long time to evaporate.
</p><p>
If the set got wet while unplugged (in a leaky attic or wet basement), for
example, or it has a pull or click knob on/off switch, then give it time
to dry out - completely.  Assuming all visible water is drained, a week
represents a minimum safe time to wait.  Don't rush it.
</p><p>
Generally, some moisture will not do any permanent damage unless the
set was on in which case you will simply have to troubleshoot it the
old-fashioned way - one problem at a time.
</p><p>
You may be tempted to use a hair drier or heat gun to speed the process
along.  But, be extra careful not to do damage
to the equipment.  <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/melted1.jpg">Slightly melted laptop keyboard</a>
is an example of a bit of overkill.  As far as I know, this was due to
a short exposure to a properly functioning blow drier.  The owner swears that
the blow drier is not overheating and that she hasn't been able to set her
hair on fire.  I can just imagine what would have happened with a real heat
gun.  They just don't make those keys the way they used to! :)

</p><h3><a name="tvdropped">TV was dropped</a></h3>

You have probably seen the TV advertisements - I don't recall what they
were for - where a late model TV is dropped out a many story window
on a bunjie cord to rebound once undamaged and without hitting a baby in
a stroller but then smash to smithereens on the sidewalk once the stroller
had moved.  Needless to say, this is generally not a recommended way to
treat a TV set!
<p>
However, mishaps do happen.
</p><p>
Assuming it survived mostly intact - the CRT didn't implode, you could still
have a variety of problems.  Immediately unplug the set!
</p><p>
If you take it in for service, the estimate you get may make the national debt
look like pocket change in comparison.  Attempting to repair anything that has
been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money for a
professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is very
risky.  There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge for
just agreeing that what you are holding was once - say - a TV, or was it a
fishtank?)
</p><p>
This doesn't mean you should not tackle it yourself.  There may be
nothing wrong or very minor problems that can easily be remedied.  The
following are likely possibilities:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Cracked circuit boards.  These can be repaired since TVs usually have
 fairly wide open single or two sided boards.
<p>
</p></li><li>Broken circuit components.  These will need to be replaced.
<p>
</p></li><li>Broken solder connections particularly to large heavy components
 on single sided boards.  Reflow the solder.  If the trace is cracked
 or lifted, repair as in (1).
<p>
</p></li><li>Broken mounting brackets.  These are usually made of cheap plastic
 and often don't survive very well.  Be creative.  Obtaining an
 exact replacement is probably not worth the trouble and expense.
<p>
</p></li><li>Components knocked out of line on the CRT envelope or neck  - deflection
 yoke, purity magnets, convergence magnets and coils, geometry correction
 magnets.  These will need to be reattached and/or realigned.  Some CRTs use
 little magnets glued to the funnel portion of the CRT envelope.  If any
 of these have come loose, it could be quite a treat to figure out where
 they went and in what orientation.
<p>
</p></li><li>Internal damage to the CRT - popped or distorted shadow mask, misaligned
 electron guns.  Unfortunately, you will probably have no way of
 identifying these since you cannot see inside the CRT.  They will not
 be apparent until all other faults have been remedied and the TV set
 is completely realigned.  At that point, extremely severe purity or
 convergence problems that do not respond to the normal adjustment
 procedure would be one indication of internal damage.  Give the TV a
 nice funeral. :(  For a large screen TV, the
 effects may be even more dramatic.
</li></ol>
<p>
If you still want to tackle a restoration:
</p><p>
As noted, unplug the TV even if it looks fine.  Until you do a thorough
internal inspection, there is no telling what may have been knocked
out of whack or broken.  Electrical parts may be shorting due to a broken
circuit board or one that has just popped free.  Don't be tempted
to apply power even if there are no obvious signs of damage - turning
it on may blow something due to a shorting circuit board.  If it is a
portable, remove the batteries.
</p><p>
Then, inspect the exterior for cracking, chipping, or dents.  In addition
to identifying cosmetic problems, this will help to locate possible areas to
check for internal damage once the covers are removed.
</p><p>
(At this point, most people will assume there is no interior damage and
plug the set back in and turn it on.  My recommendation is to resist
this temptation since as noted, this could result in further damage
making the repair more expensive if there are circuit problems.  However,
if the unit was on at the time of the "incident" or you are really
determined to get to the conclusion and would just throw the thing in
the trash if it doesn't work or blows up, go for it!  But, if you're the
more cautious type, continue with the systematic diagnosis and repair
procedure that follows.)
</p><p>
Next, remove the cover.  Confirm that the main filter capacitors are
fully discharged before touching anything.  Check for mechanical problems
like a bent or deformed brackets, cracked plastic parts, and anything that
may have shifted position or jumped from its mountings.  Inspect for loose
parts or pieces of parts  - save them all as some critical magnets, for
example, are just glued to the CRT and may have popped off.
</p><p>
Carefully straighten any bent metal parts.  Replace parts that were
knocked loose, glue and possibly reinforce cracked or broken plastic.
Plastics, in particular, are troublesome because most glues - even plastic
cement - do not work very well.  Using a splint (medical term) or sistering
(construction term) to reinforce a broken plastic part is often a good
idea.  Use multiple layers of Duco Cement or clear windshield sealer
and screws (sheetmetal or machine screws may be best depending on the
thickness and type of plastic).  Wood glue and Epoxy do not work well
on plastic.  Some brands of superglue, PVC pipe cement, or plastic hobby
cement may work depending on the type of plastic.
</p><p>
Inspect for any broken electronic components - these will need to be replaced.
Check for blown fuses - the initial impact may have shorted something
momentarily which then blew a fuse.
</p><p>
There is always a risk that the initial impact has already fried electronic
parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit traces and
there will still be problems even after repairing the visible damage and/or
replacing the broken components.  This is most likely if the set was actually
on but most modern TVs have some circuitry energized at all times.
</p><p>
Examine the circuit boards for any visible breaks or cracks.  These will
be especially likely at the corners where the stress may have been greatest.
If you find **any** cracks, no matter how small in the circuit board, you
will need to carefully inspect to determine if any circuit traces run
across these cracks.  If they do, then there are certainly breaks in
the circuitry which will need to be repaired.  Circuit boards in consumer
equipment are almost never more than two layers so repair is possible but
if any substantial number of traces are broken, it will take time and patience.
Do not just run over them with solder as this will not last.  Use a fine
tipped low wattage soldering iron and run #22-26 gauge insulated wires
between convenient endpoints - these don't need to be directly on either
side of the break.  Double check each connection after soldering for correct
wiring and that there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.
</p><p>
If the circuit board is beyond hope or you do not feel you would be able
to repair it in finite time, replacements may be available but their cost
is likely to be more than the equipment is worth.  Locating a junk unit of the
same model to cannibalize for parts may be a more realistic option.
</p><p>
Degauss the set as any impact may magnetize the CRT.  Power cycling may
work but a manual degaussing is best.
</p><p>
Once all visible damage has been repaired and broken parts have been replaced,
power it up and see what happens.  Be prepared to pull the plug if there
are serious problems (billowing smoke or fireworks would qualify).
</p><p>
If there are obvious problems with color, disconnect (or disable) two
of the 3 primary colors with a B/W picture (color control turned all the
way down) or solid raster displayed.  If the raster is not now a pure
color, you have a CRT or CRT purity adjustment problem.
</p><p>
Perform any purity, convergence, or other realignment as needed.
</p><p>
Then proceed to address any remaining problems one at a time.

</p><h3><a name="tvrcleanio">Really cleaning a TV inside and out</a></h3>

(This was written for computer monitors but applies equally well to modern
TV sets.)
<p>
(From: Dr. Ludwig Steininger (drsteininger@t-online.de).)
</p><p>
Often I get defective monitors, which are more than 5 years old, and have been 
run in offices for 8 to 10 hours/day. So, their case and pcbs usually are very
dirty and dusty.
</p><p>
What do I do (it's no joke!): After removing the case I carefully put them in
a bath (on a flexible layer) and let them have a intensive shower of pure cold
water (for 1 to 2 minutes).  Additionally, the case is cleaned with soap or a
detergent containing liquid (being careful, not to spill to much of it onto
the PCBs). After rinsing with fresh clear water, dust and other kinds of dirt
are removed and the monitors look new again.  Then I allow all drops of water
to run off. This can effectively be supported by turning the monitor on
another side from time to time (duration: approximately 1 hour). Before
turning on AC again, I let the wet monitor dry in ambient air for about 2 days
(in the  sunshine this can be finished in 1 day only).
</p><p>
This procedure has been applied for many monitors. I've never had any bad 
experiences (it's very important to wait, until the pcbs are really dry!). 
Considering this experience, I just can't imagine, that it might not be 
possible, to "save" a TV set or computer monitor, which has been drowned or 
some liquid has been spilled, and AC has been plugged off ASAP (although I've 
never had such a case). I think, that in such a case, it's important to have a
rapid shower in order to prevent corrosion and deposits.
</p><p>
By the way: I know a German company, which uses water from cleaning PCBs of 
computer hardware for cleaning them after being contaminated by smoke from 
a fire.
</p><p>
So, in case of spillage, one has nothing to loose. Just try to shower your 
monitor or TV set!

</p><h3><a name="tvrcleanpr">Cleaning the screen on a projection set</a></h3>

(From: Filip "I'll buy a vowel" Gieszczykiewicz (filipg@repairfaq.org).)
<p>
I will assume you want to clean the front part of the screen.  In some
sets, the screen is not smooth as it is a Fresnel lens to help direct
the light.  Since it's plastic, you must NOT use any harsh
chemicals like Windex (ammonia), etc. Best is to use plain water with
mild soap, wet a soft sponge/cotton cloth, SQUEEZE WATER OUT OF IT,
and wipe the screen using gentle, vertical strokes - repeating the
wet-squeeze-wipe steps to prevent from scratching the screen. I will
also presume it's just dust and grime and not kids with wax pencils
that you're trying to clean.
</p><p>
Where cleaning of the inner surface and/or between multiple surfaces is
required, some disassembly will be needed.  A service manual would be
highly desirable to guide you and the optics may also need cleaning.

</p><h3><a name="tvsmenuwnga">Setup menus will not go away or hieroglyphics on screen</a></h3>

Both these problems could be caused by a faulty microcontroller or
its associated circuitry.  However, bad connections in the vicinity
of the controller logic could also be at fault.
<p>
Unless you see something obvious, you will need schematics.

</p><h3><a name="tvadjlost">Setup adjustments lost - TV service codes</a></h3>

Many modern TVs have RAM, somewhat like the CMOS SETUP memory in your PC,
that store all factory adjustments.  When power is lost, there is power
surge, lightning strike nearby, nuclear detonation or EMP, it may
have put bad information into the ram and thrown it out of adjustment.  There
is a way to get into the service mode (depress and hold a secret button
down and turn set on, special combination of buttons on the remote, etc.)
and then use the remote to reinitialize and adjust the problems out.
<p>
HOWEVER, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DOING YOU COULD GIVE YOURSELF WORSE
PROBLEMS.  YOU COULD EVEN BLOW VERY EXPENSIVE PARTS WITH SOME SETS!
</p><p>
Try not to make any unnecessary changes and document every change you make!!!
That way you can go back if you do anything wrong (hopefully).  However, some
changes - even if nothing fails - will result in an unviewable picture thus
making it extremely difficult to see what you are doing.
</p><p>
The Sams' Photofact manual for your set should describe this process - you may
be able to get Photofacts from a local library, or you can buy them from Radio
Shack or a place like MCM Electronics or an electronics distributor.  The
June, 1998, issue of "Electronic Servicing and Technology" (ES&amp;T) had an
article on service mode if you have access to this publication (it won't be
in your public library).
</p><p>
<a href="http://tv-servis.netfirms.com/">Service Mode World Wide</a>
has listings for hundreds of TV models.  Although
they sell this information and software, they have some free downloads
(as of March 2008) at <a href="http://tv-servis.netfirms.com/dl.html">Service
Mode Downloads</a>.
</p><p>
Some examples follow.  You would need to check the service information for
your specific model to be sure.  However, trying the procedures described
below probably will not hurt.  The TV will just ignore you if it doesn't
like your codes!  However, if you do get in, make sure you know what you are
doing or your original problem may be inconsequential compared to your new
ones!

 </p></li><li>Press DOWN arrow button until you see HOR-SHIFT and a number.  LEFT
  arrow key moves the picture left (smaller number), RIGHT arrow key does
  opposite.
 </li></ol>
<p>
 IMPORTANT! To LOCK setting in, press MENU button to back out of
 GEOMETRY mode.  Then shut off TV and turn on again.  Picture will be
 shifted.
</p><p>
 NOTE: After making any changes as per the above procedure, the Closed
 Caption feature will be activated during normal sound settings.  Enter the
 regular MENU mode, select FEATURES and enter CLOSED CAP to reset the
 CAPTION MODE to CC MUTE.
</p><p>
 NOTE: Other features in GEOMETRY mode also influence the picture image.  If
 you intend to tinker, first make a list of all features/numbers.  Don't
 panic if the VER-SLOPE feature chops the screen in half when you use the L-
 R arrow buttons to change the number.  Just press MENU to back out and the
 picture will restore itself as per the new setting.  After backing out of
 GEOMETRY mode with MENU you can reenter GEOMETRY mode without having to
 shut off the TV - just select GEOMETRY and use the right arrow button to
 reenter.  Backing out with MENU merely locks in the most recent setting
 changes.

 Salora 28F8C: Within 6 seconds from a cold-boot press [pause],[stop],[play]
 and [fast forward] quickly after each other. The TV will then enter the
 setup mode by displaying "SA" in the LED display. The user interface for
 this is an absolute nightmare. You input via the remote control (the layout
 is in no way intuitive!) and all the feedback you get is via the small LED
 display. I started navigating the mode and quickly figured out that [+] and
 [-] are used to navigate between different entities. You always start in "SA"
 and can cycle through 15 different entities before you end back in "SA".
 There are some basic and some very hardcore functions.  (At the moment I
 have managed to mess my TV up really well, with the primary colours
 mis-aligned - which also seems to affect the AFC somehow.)  [VolUp] and
 [VolDn] adjusts the "primary property" of the entity.

<h3><a name="tvsmcaution">Service menu caution</a></h3>

Even changing a parameter which results in the loss of the picture could
require replacing the EEPROM if you cannot get the set to come on and view
the service menu to reset!
<p>
However, it may be possible to drive the HOT with an external source
so you can see the menus for setup.
</p><p>
CAUTION: there is some risk.  Should drive the HOT with too low a frequency,
it may blow due to flyback core saturation.  Use a series light bulb to
minimize this possibility.

<h3><a name="tvsnumulc">Strange number in upper left corner in Magnavox service mode</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"When I put my Magnavox in service mode a number comes up on the top left
 of the screen. I see no description of it in the service manual. Is this
 an hours used timer? Is it actually in hours?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Mister M. (mister-m@ix.netcom.com) and zapper (zap@mhv.net).)
</p><p>
This is actually a usege timer in hexidecimal. 
</p><p>
(Hey, at least it is not binary. :-) --- Sam.)

</p><h3><a name="tvdwstorage">TV doesn't work after being in storage</a></h3>

So the TV you carefully stuffed in a corner of the garages is now totally
dead.  You swear it was working perfectly a year ago.
<p>
Assuming there was absolutely no action when you turned it on, this has
all the classic symptoms of a bad connection.  These could be cold/cracked
solder joints at large components like transformers, power resistors, or
connectors and connectors that need to be cleaned or reseated.  By 'no action'
I mean not even a tweet, bleep, or crackle from anything.
</p><p>
To narrow it down further, if careful prodding of the circuit board(s) and
various large components with a well insulated stick does not induce the set
to come on, even momentarily, check the following:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Locate the horizontal output transistor.  It will be in a TO3 metal
 (most likely on an older set) or TOP3 plastic package on a heat sink.
 With the set unplugged, confirm that there is no voltage across C to E and
 then measure between them with an ohmmeter.  In at least one direction it
 should be fairly high - 1K or more.  This confirms that the HOT is
 probably good.
<p>
 (There is also a slight chance that there is a low voltage regulator
 in addition to the horizontal output, so don't get them confused.  The
 horizontal output transistor will be near the flyback transformer and
 yoke connector.)
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Trace back from the HOT collector to the flyback and through the flyback
 to the B+ feed from the power supply.  Clip a voltmeter between this point
 and the HOT emitter.  Make sure the leads are well insulated and can't
 accidentally short to anything.  (This test can be performed across C to E
 of the HOT but if the horizontal deflection were to start up unexpectadly,
 the meter could be damaged by the high voltage pulses on the HOT collector.
 But if you can't find the B+ source, it may be worth the risk.)  Plug it in
 and turn it on.
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>If the problem is in the low voltage (line) power supply, there will
  be no substantial voltage across C to E.
<p>
  You should be able to trace from the power line forward to find the bad
  part though a schematic will help greatly.
</p><p>
 </p></li><li>If the problem is in the startup circuit or horizontal oscillator/driver,
  then there will be something on the order of 100 to 160 V across C to E.
<p>
  In this case, a schematic may be essential.
 </p></li></ul>

<p>
There is also a slight chance that there is a low voltage regulator
in addition to the horizontal output, so don't get them confused.  The
horizontal output transistor will be near the flyback transformer and
yoke connector.

</p><h3><a name="tvoldertvs">Older TVs with multiple intermittent problems</a></h3>

If the set is say, a GE, with a manufacturing date around 1980, it is possible
you have one of those circuit boards best described as bad solder joints
held together with a little copper.  In this case, prodding may get the set 
started.  The circuit boards in these sets were double sided using what
were called 'rivlets' for vias.  The rivlets were relatively massive -
literally little copper rivets - and they were not adequately
heated  during assembly so there were bucketloads of cold solder joints
that showed up during middle age.  I repaired one of these by literally
resoldering top and bottom of every one of the darn things with a high
wattage iron.

<h3><a name="tvburnsml" :="">TV has burning smell</a></h3>

Assuming there are no other symptoms:
<p>
If this appears after extended operation - an hour or more - it may
just be a build up of dust, dirt, and grime over the years.  After
understanding the safety info, some careful vacuuming inside may help.
Just don't be tempted to turn any screws or adjustments!
</p><p>
Dust is attracted to the high voltage section in particular - even the
front faceplate of the CRT collects a lot and should be wiped with a damp
cloth from time to time.
</p><p>
If the symptoms develop quickly - in a few minutes or less, then there
could still be a dust problem - a power resistor may be heating a wad of
it but other possibilities need to be considered.
</p><p>
If not dust, then probably in the power supply but realize that TVs don't
have a nice metal case labeled 'power supply'.  It is just a bunch of stuff
scattered around the main board.  Without identifying the part that is
heating, a diagnosis is tough especially if the set really does
work fine otherwise.  However, if a series regulator were faulty and putting
out too much voltage, the set could appear to work properly but in fact
have excessive power dissipation in certain components.  If cleaning the dust
does not solve the problem, you will probably need a schematic to identify
the correct voltages.

</p><h3><a name="tvsdnptq">Static discharge noise and picture tube quality</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I bought a 29" TV a couple of weeks ago and I have noticed that after being
 switched on for &gt; about 15/20 minutes, whenever the picture changes from a
 "light" scene to a darker scene, the set makes a crackling noise. It sounds
 as though there has been a build-up of static and it is being discharged. I
 have never noticed this in a TV before and I was wondering if this is normal
 and acceptable behaviour for a large-screen TV?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).) 
</p><p>
It probably is normal.  Whether it is acceptable is a personal matter.   In
some geographic areas no countermeasures are taken at all... 
</p><p>
When the scene changes from bright to dark, the beam current is reduced to
practically zero. As a result, the high voltage rises. (The high voltage
supply has a relatively high internal impedance.) The high voltage is
connected to the inside layer of the picture tube. A voltage change on the
inside will also cause a voltage change on uncovered parts of the outside,
especially on the part of the picture tube that is hidden under the deflection
coils. This causes little sparks between the picture tube surface and the
inside of the deflection coils and this is accompanied by a crackling sound.
</p><p>
On the better picture tubes, a dark "anti-crackle coating" is painted on the
picture tube near the deflection coil.  This is a very high impedance coating,
dark black, much darker than the usual aquadag coating over the rest of the
picture tube. You should be able to see the difference.
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, the outside of the picture tube near the deflection
coil is not coated then you have a problem. Then you will hear strong
crackling also at switch-on and switch-off. Normally you shouldn't see such a
'cheap' picture tube on the European market...
</p><p>
The area of the picture tube around the anode connector is also not coated,
for obvious reasons. Normally that should not cause any significant
sound. Same goes for the front of the screen and neither should the anode
cable crackle.
</p><p>
In a dark room you should be able to see from the tiny blue flashes where the
sound comes from. This is perhaps best observed at switch-on and switch-off
(with a black picture on the screen). Try and keep the back cover mounted !

</p><h3><a name="tvrpdptrcu">Revival of dead or tired remote control units</a></h3>

There are two types of problems with hand held remote controls: they
have legs of their own and they get abused or forgotten.  I cannot
help you with walking remotes.
<p>
Where response is intermittent or the reliable operating distance is
reduced, first check the batteries and battery contacts.  If some buttons
are intermittent or dead, than the most likely cause is dirty or worn
contacts under the rubber buttons or on the circuit board.
</p><p>
If there is no response to any functions by the TV or VCR, verify that any
mode switches are set correctly (on both the remote and the TV or VCR).
Unplug the TV or VCR for 30 seconds (not just power off, unplug).  This
sometimes resets a microcontroller that may have been confused by a
power surge.  Confirm that the remote has not accidentally been set to
an incorrect mode (VCR instead of TV, for example).  If it a universal
type, it may have lost its programming - reset it.  Make sure you are
using the proper remote if have multiple similar models.
</p><p>
Test the remote with an IR detector.  An IR detector card can be purchased
for about $6.  Alternatively, build the circuit at the end of this document.
If the remote is putting out an IR signal, then the remote or the TV or VCR may
have forgotten its settings or the problem may be in the TV or VCR and not
the hand unit.  The following is just a summary - more detailed information
is available in the companion document: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/irrfaq.htm">Notes on the
Troubleshooting and Repair of Hand Held Remote Controls</a>.
</p><p>
Problems with remote hand units:
</p><p>
All except (1) and (2) require disassembly - there may be a screw or two and
then the case will simply 'crack' in half by gently prying with a knife or
screwdriver.  Look for hidden snap interlocks.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Dead batteries - solution obvious.
<p>
</p></li><li>Corroded battery contacts,   Thoroughly remove chemical deposits. Clean
 contacts with pencil eraser and/or sandpaper or nailfile.
<p>
</p></li><li>Broken connections often between battery contacts and circuit board,
 possibly on the circuit board - resolder.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad resonator or crystal - replace, but diagnosing this without
 an oscilloscope may be tough.  Broken connections on resonator legs
 are common.
<p>
</p></li><li>Dirt/spills/gunk preventing keys from operating reliably.  Disassemble
 and wash rubber membrane and circuit board with water and mild detergent
 and/or then alcohol - dry completely.
<p>
</p></li><li>Worn or corroded contact pads on circuit board.  Clean and then use
 conductive Epoxy or paint or metal foil to restore.
<p>
</p></li><li>Worn or dirty pads on rubber keypad.  Clean.  If worn, use conductive
 paint or metal foil to restore.
<p>
</p></li><li>Cracked circuit board - can usually be repaired as these are usually single
 sided with big traces.  Scrape off insulating coating and jumper breaks
 with fine wire and solder.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad LED. If IR tester shows no output, remove LED and power it from
 a 9 V battery in series with a 500 ohm resistor.  If still no output,
 replace with readily available high power IR LED.  Otherwise, check
 driver circuits.
<p>
</p></li><li>Bad IC - if it is a custom chip, forget it!  Failure of the IC
 is usually quite unlikely.
<p>
 (The following is from Duane P Mantick:)
</p><p>
 An awful lot of IR remotes use IC's from the same or similar series. A
 common series comes from NEC and is the uPD1986C which, incidentally is
 called out in the NTE replacements book as an NTE1758. A lot of these
 chips are cheap and not too difficult to find, and are made in
 easy-to-work-with 14 or 16 pin DIP packages. Unless you have no soldering
 or desoldering skills, replacement isn't difficult.
</p></li></ol>
<p>
There are a large variety of universal remotes available from $10-$100. For
general TV/VCR/cable use, the $10 variety are fine. However, the preprogrammed
variety will not provide special functions like programming of a TV or VCR.
Don't even think about going to the original manufacturer - they will charge
an arm and a leg (or more). However, places like MCM Electronics do stock a
variety of original remotes - prices range from $9 - $143 (Wow $143, for just
a stupid remote! It doesn't even have high definition sound or anything
exotic). The average price is around $40.

</p><h3><a name="tvpwirrecv">Problems with the IR remote receiver</a></h3>

Although the hand unit is most likely to be the cause of any problems
with the remote control, it is also possible for the IR receive module
to fail or for power to it to be missing.  Microcontroller problems as
well can result in similar symptoms.
<p>
First confirm that the hand unit is putting out the correct code.  If it
is a programmable type, try re-entering the settings for your TV.  Install
a set of fresh batteries.  Try a different remote if possible.  Use an IR
detector to verify IR emissions (see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrpdptrcu">Revival
of dead or tired remote control units</a>).
</p><p>
The IR receiver is often a self contained module connected to the rest of
the TV's circuitry by 3 wires: Power (+12 V typical), Ground, and Signal Out.
</p><p>
The IR receiver module will be located directly behind the IR window.  Test
by confirming that DC power is present.  A schematic will tell you exactly
what it should be but figure on 6 to 12 V if you do not have one.  If this
is present and you have an oscilloscope, put is on the Signal Out.  You should
see the demodulated data stream corresponding to whatever key is pressed on
the hand unit.  It should be a logic level signal swinging between 0 and
the supply or +5 volts.
</p><p>
If there is no power, then a bad cable connection or blown fusable resistor
may be the cause.  If there is correct power but no signal, a fault internal
to the IR module is likely.  The internal circuitry may be a combination
of special ICs and discrete components.  The Sams'' or service manual may or
may not provide the details.  There may be an adjustment for the carrier
frequency but don't be tempted to touch this unless you have exhasuted
other possibilities - and them mark it first!
</p><p>
If the signal is present, then there may be a problem in the microcontroller
or other logic on the mainboard.  This will require a schematic to proceed
further.

</p><h3><a name="tvsylyoem">So you lost your original remote (or it fell in the toilet)</a></h3>

An exact replacement remote will be easiest to use but may do significant
harm to your bank account.
<p>
For example, you cannot add or remove channels from a typical Sony TV using
the common universal remotes.
</p><p>
(From: Ed Ellers (edellers@delphi.com).)
</p><p>
Universal Electronics' "One For All" remote controls can reproduce these
codes, and any others on any Sony TV (among others).  Typically you'd press
[MAGIC] and then 1-9-4 to add a channel or 1-9-0 to erase one; to start the
auto program mode you'd press [MAGIC] and then 1-2-4.

</p><h3><a name="tvloudspk">Loudspeakers and TVs</a></h3>

Loudspeakers incorporate powerful magnets - the larger the speaker, the
larger the magnet.  However, anyone who goes ballistic when the mention
is made of a loudspeaker near a TV or monitor, should take their Vallium.
<p>
The fringe fields outside the speaker box will not be that great.  They
may affect the picture perhaps to the point of requiring degauss.  The
normal degauss activated at power-on will usually clear up any color purity
problems (assuming the loudspeakers have been moved away).  At worst, manual
degauss will be needed.  The CRT will not be damaged.  The maximum
field - inaccessible at the voice coil -  is quite strong.  However, even
for non-shielded loudspeakers, the magnetic field decays rapidly with
distance especially since the core structure is designed to concentrate
as much of the field as possible in the gap where the voice coil travels.
</p><p>
However, keeping speakers away from CRTs is a good idea.
</p><p>
Now, you really should keep your superconducting magnetic resonance imager
magnet at least in the next room.....

</p><h3><a name="tvsoraecaps">Should I replace all the electrolytic capacitors if I find a bad one?</a></h3>

When a bad capacitor is found in a TV, the question of course arises
as to the likelihood of other capacitors going bad in short order.
It might be worth checking (other) caps in the power supply or hot
(temperature) areas but you could spend you whole life replacing **all**
the electrolytics in your older equipment!

(Original request from rogerj@apex.com):

"A sweet little old lady has duped me into repairing her old GE 13" color

 After 15 to 20 min. of travail, I discover that a previous "repairman" has glued

<p>
Well, you certainly did not kill the caps.  Anything that sits for a few

<p>
It could be that the convergence (including pincushion) circuits are still

</p><p>
Other things that can effect horizontal size while still giving you a complete

<li>Voltage to horizontal output transistor low.  Is there a voltage regulator
 in your set?  The one I have has none.  I assume your line voltage is ok.

 you know, the yoke may have been replaced with the wrong part.
<p>
</p></li><li>Yoke improperly positioned on tube neck.

</p></li><li>Excessive high Voltage.  This is usually not adjustable.

</p><h3><a name="tvphanspot">Phantom spot or blob on CRT after set is shut off</a></h3>

(Portions of the following from a video engineer at Philips.)
<p>
Why is there a splotch of colored light at the center of the CRT after
I kill power to my TV?  Why does this not happen if the plug is pulled
instead?  It seems to last for hours (well maybe minutes at least).
</p><p>
A broad diffused glow (not a distinct spot in the middle of the screen)
that lasts for a few seconds to minutes is called 'afterglow' and may be
considered 'normal' for your model.  The warm CRT cathodes continue to
emit electrons due to the high voltage that is still present even though
the signal circuits may have ceased to operate.
</p><p>
For more sharply defined spots there are two phenomena:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Thermal emission from a cathode that has not yet cooled off (and this
 could take several minutes) gives a more or less circular spot near the
 centre.  It is actually 3 spots from the 3 cathodes, we at Philips call
 them 'Christmas balls'.
<p>
</p></li><li>Field emission from sharp whiskers on any electron gun part gives a much
 sharper spot, sometimes with a moon-shaped halo around it.  Even with the
 filament off, there may be some electron emission from these sharp points
 on the cold cathode(s) due to the strong high voltage (HV) electric fields
 in the electron gun.  I do not know how likely this is or why this is so.
</li></ol>
<p>
The shape of the spot is an inverted image of the shape of the emitting
area(s) on the electron guns cathodes.
</p><p>
The visibility of both effects depends in the same way on the decay time of
the high voltage (HV/EHT) on the anode.
</p><p>
When turned off with the remote or front panel button, you are not actually
killing AC power but are probably switching off the deflection and signal
circuits.  This leaves the HV to decay over a few minutes or longer as it
is drained by the current needed to feed the phantom spot or blob.
</p><p>
When you pull the plug, however, you are killing AC input and all the 
voltages decay together and in particular, the video signal may be present
for long enough to keep the brightness (and beam current) up and drain the
HV quickly.  Whether this actually happens depends on many factors - often
not dealt with by the designers of the set.
</p><p>
A proper design (who knows, yours may simply have been broken from day 1 or
simply be typical of your model) would ensure that the HV is drained quickly
or that the other bias voltages on the CRT are clamped to values that would
blank the CRT once the set is off. If the problem developed suddenly, then
this circuitry may have failed.  On the other hand, if it has been gradually
getting more pronounced, then the characteristics of the CRT or other
circuitry may have changed with age.
</p><p>
In most sets it is left to chance whether the picture tube capacitance will
be discharged by beam current at switch-off.  It may simply be due to the
behaviour of the video control IC when its supply voltage drops that causes
the cathodes to be driven to white and this may not be formally specified by
the manufacturer of the IC.  Some of of the latest sets have an explicit
circuit to discharge the EHT at shutdown.
</p><p>
As noted in the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsafg">Safety guidelines</a>, the HV
charge on the CRT capacitance can be present for a long time.  A service
technician should be very aware of that before touching HV parts!
</p><p>
Interestingly, most sets for the Asian Pacific market have a bleeder resistor
built in that will discharge the EHT without the need for a white flash at
switch-off.  These will in fact drive the beam to black at switch-off via a
negative voltage to the CRT G1 electrode.  The AP market is very sensitive
to proper set behaviour, they don't like a white flash.
</p><p>
In short, it all depends on the demands of the particular market, the chance
of the picture tube producing a spot/blob, and the mood of the designer.
</p><p>
So, it may not be worth doing anything to 'fix' this unless the splotch is
so bright (more so than normal video and for an extended time) that
CRT phosphor damage could result.  This is usually not a problem with
direct view TVs but would definitely be a concern with high intensity
projection tubes.
</p><p>
On the other hand, your phantom blob may provide for some interesting
conversation at your next party!

</p><h3><a name="tvcbspo">Comments on bright spot at power-off</a></h3>

With really old TVs, it was almost expected that when shut off, the raster
would collapse to a spot which would then gradually fade away.  If severe
enough, the result after awhile would be a permanent dark spot in the center
of the screen.  Modern sets usually avoid this by forcing
the CRT to be blanked for a few seconds after power-off while the high voltage
decays or unblanked as the raster collapses to discharge the high voltage
quickly with a white flash.  However, claiming they all do this by design
may be optimistic! :)
<p>
The following was in response to questions about a Sony TV but should apply in
general.
</p><p>
(From: JURB6006 (jurb6006@aol.com).)
</p><p>
I think in this case the filter for the supply to the final video outs has
gotten to a point where is discharges faster than the tube. Sony designs
usually use fast blanking at power down, but it can only blank while the
+220 VDC line is alive.  There might also be a cap between the 220V line
and the G1 biasing circuit. Also Sony's almost always incorporate some sort
of HV bleeder but if it opens up usually there is a convergence problem.
If it's not any of the above, the plot thickens. Look for a bad diode, or
even an active spot killer circuit that has failed.
</p><p>
You might want to look into this, as I tell customers, when it collapses to a
line it is 480 times as bright, it won't <i>look</i> 480 times as bright
because the phosphor simply cant put out that much light. I've also made
comments in here on how fast a CRT will burn if the yoke is unplugged. It's
then the original 480X multiplied by 640. If that beam is in focus that means
the "drive" to the phosphor is over 300,000 X what it should be. Even if the
spot is defocused to 100X it's normal size, that is still 3,000X the current on
that part of the screen. Even if yours doesn't burn the screen, in time you
might expect a minor purity problem in that area on a fine pitch color CRT.
This is an effect known as "doming", and it happened even on some low
resolution NTSC TVs! It usually happened more at the sides, and if it became
permanent you could fix it up if you used enough stick-on magnets, but you
can't do that in the middle.
</p><p>
I bet the thing is a real pain to work on too, so I might consider just never
shutting it off, or a simple modification. If G1 is grounded, it is easy. One
resistor, a cap and a diode, ba-da-bing ba-da-boom. Two caps if you like to be
fastidious.  There are some designs in which this will not work. It does work
99% though, if the vidouts are driven they will discharge the +220 VDC supply,
what I do is to AC couple the supply to the G1. It can be done with three
component, but there are enhancements I recommend to protect the CRT from
excessive K-G1 voltage. Don't want to cause a short there. Five or six
components will do it on almost anything.

</p><h3><a name="tvdispose">Disposing of dead TVs (CRTs and charged HV capacitors)</a></h3>

I don't know what the law says, but for safety, here is my recommendation:
<p>
Treat the CRT with respect - the implosion hazard should not be minimized.
A large CRT will have over 10 tons of air pressure attempting to crush it.
Wear eye protection whenever dealing with the CRT.  Handle the CRT by the
front - not the neck or thin funnel shaped envelope.  Don't just toss it
in the garbage - it is a significant hazard.  The vacuum can be safely
released (Let out?  Sucked in?  What does one do with an unwanted vacuum?)
without spectacular effects by breaking the glass seal in the center of the
CRT socket (may be hidden by the indexing plastic of the socket).  Cover the
entire CRT with a heavy blanket when doing this for additional protection.
Once the vacuum is gone, it is just a big glass bottle though there may be
some moderately hazardous materials in the phosphor coatings and of course,
the glass and shadow mask will have many sharp edges if it is broken.
</p><p>
In addition, there could be a nice surprise awaiting anyone disconnecting the
high voltage wire - that CRT capacitance can hold a charge for quite a while.
Since it is being scrapped, a screwdriver under the suction cap HV connector
should suffice.
</p><p>
The main power supply filter caps should have discharged on their own
after any reasonable length of time (measured in terms of minutes, not
days or years).
</p><p>
Of course around here, TVs are just tossed intact which is fortunate
for scavengers like me who would not be happy at all with pre-safed TVs!

</p><h3><a name="tvssconcab">Shock and/or spark when connecting cable or other A/V components</a></h3>

TVs with hot chassis - where signal ground is actually line connected and
at some intermediate (and dangerous) voltage - will have an isolation block
in between the tuner and antenna/cable connections.  TVs with isolated power
supplies may have some bypass capacitors between the power supply and signal
grounds (including the A/V shields if there are A/V connectors).  It is
possible for a failure to result in a serious safety hazard where the RF
(antenna/cable) or A/V connectors become electrically live.
<p>
However, a tingle or small spark might be normal.  RFI bypass caps between the
AC input and shield on the connector could result in some leakage - 50 V or
more might be indicated using a high impedance multimeter.  This is harmless.
Reversing the plug in the AC socket (if it is not polarized or if you are using
an unpolarized extension cord) might eliminate or greatly reduce the effect.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, it should be checked out.  Measure the resistance between each
side of the AC plug and the RF and AV connector shields.  It should be 1 M ohm
or more.  Test for voltage between the cable (or other device) connector and
earth ground.  If there is anything significant, test the resistance on the
device between its shield and its power plug as above - other devices may have
RFI bypass caps or be defective as well.

</p><h3><a name="tvmacrovision">What is the deal with Macrovision copy protection?</a></h3>

(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
<p>
JVC owns the patent for VHS. JVC has made a deal with Macrovision that from 
a certain date in the past *no* VHS recorder licenced by JVC shall be able 
to record any video signal that contains Macrovision's copy protection 
pulses. Any video recorder from before that date (VHS or other) might
well work OK on the altered video signal ! The copy protection pulses 
upset the video-AGC and H-sync. TV's usually don't have a video-AGC.
The stabilizer box removes the extra pulses and makes it into a normal 
video signal again. No VCR should ever know the difference, so they 
should all record properly again.
</p><p>
At the same time, all TV's are required to ignore the copy protection
pulses. As a TV-designer I can tell you that this is sometimes far from
trivial. Not in the least because in the beginning we were not included
in "the deal". There may be TV's around whose brightness and/or sync will 
be disturbed by the Macrovision pulses. Officially, this is the reason
for existance of the stabilizer boxes: to view better, not to copy better.
Unofficially, they are sold for copying, of course.
</p><p>
The next step will be that digital-TV decoders will output an analog TV
signal with Macrovision copy-protection pulses so that you may watch but 
not record your pay-per-view program. Same problem, same solution ...
</p><p>
And I thought that PAL/Secam/NTSC were *standards*, sigh ...
</p><p>
Whether they like it or not (and from personal experience I can tell you that
we don't like it) it is the responsibility of the TV set-maker (in your case
Sony) to build a TV that takes the Macrovision copy protection pulses without
showing any side effects on the screen.  Seems like they didn't do a good job
on your TV :-). But they will have to fix this, your complaint is valid. I
think in this case it may be the dealer's responsibility too, maybe you can
trade it for a different brand ? And do try it out first ...
</p><p>
Sadly, more complex TV's seem to suffer more than the simpler, old-fashioned,
designs. Unfortunately, Macrovision seems to be satisfied when their pulses
do not affect the majority of (mostly older) TV's.  In your Sony TV, the
clamping circuit seems to be affected by some ultra-black pulses in the signal.
Maybe an anti-Macrovision decoder can help you, officially they are designed
for *this* purpose.

</p><h3><a name="tvagccopypr">AGC and copy protection</a></h3>

(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>RF-AGC which compensates for different signal strength at the aerial,
 it measures RF amplitude and is *not* sensitive to video contents
 because with negative modulation the sync is the peak and is constant,
 this AGC will not work on CVBS (baseband video) inputs.
<p>
</p></li><li>Video-AGC which normalizes baseband signals which enter *after* the
 tuner-IF. A.o. this compensates for different signal strengths when
 you connect two VCRs together. It measures peak-white, so it *is*
 sensitive to video content and thus to the Macrovision pulses.
</li></ol>
<p>
And: A television does NOT have a video-AGC, unless you want to call the beam
current limiter circuits an AGC.  (Exception: the Secam-L system with positive
modulation requires an RF-AGC which measures peak-white instead of peak-sync.)
</p><p>
The RF-AGC does not see the peak-white of the anti-copy pulses.
If you connect the VCR to the TV via the CVBS (baseband) input, then
the RF-AGC is not even in the path. Still, it may be disturbed.
But the sync separator may see the extra inserted Hsync pulses, and
due to the phase disturbance the video clamping may be disturbed too.

<p>
</p></li><li>If the clock reference is power line derived, noisy power can sometimes
 result in erratic timekeeping though running fast is probably more common

(From: Ren Tescher (ren@rap.ucar.edu).)
<p>
My Christmas repair story wasn't so happy.
</p><p>
I worked as TV repairman for an appliance store.
</p><p>
On a very cold (20 below zero Fahrenheit) evening a man bought a new 25"
console for the family.
</p><p>
As we loaded it into the back of their pickup truck, we *told* them.  "Do not
plug this in until it warms back up to room temperature."  They nodded and
said "uh-huh, okay".
</p><p>
They lived about 15 minutes away.
</p><p>
25 minutes later we get a telephone call...
</p><p>
"Hey! that TV you sold us don't work!"
</p><p>
So we ended up loading another TV into our delivery van, drove out to their
place.  Unloaded it, and WAITED until the thing was warm enough to plug in.
</p><p>
Needless to say, I got home late that Christmas Eve and had brand new TV
console waiting for my repair back at the shop.

</p><h3><a name="tvfconnbor">F-connector broken off rear of TV or VCR</a></h3>

Sometimes this just happens due to poor manufacturing and a slight tug.
However, usually, there has been some severe trauma - like the TV or VCR
falling off a shelf while still attached.  When else would it fall off a
shelf? :-)
<p>
I recently repaired a Panasonic VCR with a dangling F-connector.  It required
removing the cover, main board, unsoldering the A/V block and part of the
power supply, just to get at the RF modulator.  Then it was a simple matter
of resoldering the center conductor to the printed circuit board (fortunately,
nothing else was damaged) and the shell of the F-connector to the metal box.
</p><p>
From: Glenn Watkins <blueribb@comcat.com>
</blueribb@comcat.com></p><p>
We get a lot of sets with broken "F" connectors broken off - both VCR's and
TV's. The job can be quite involved depending on the exact set. It may take
an hour just to open it, remove the tuner or RF modulator and open the case.
Then if you're lucky, there is no additional damage inside the unit due to
people probing with pencils, screwdrivers, etc.
</p><p>
On some TV's including Sharp, there is a antenna(cable) isolation device
that connects between the tuner and antenna. This device comes in a few
flavors and is very easy to install if broken. I've seen them as cheap as
$4.95 each mail order.

<h2>Some Model Specific Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="tvepwoge">Erratic problems with older GE TVs</a></h3>

Older GE TVs used double sided circuit boards with poor-man's vias - rivets
soldered to the traces top and bottom.  These have been called 'Rivlets' and
'Griplets'.  Unfortunately, whoever did the design didn't realize that (1) the
the rivets did not heat adequately during soldering and (2) the expansion
coefficients of the rivets and circuit board were not qutie identical.
<p>
Thus, erratic problems are almost a certainty with these TVs.  Normal logical
troubleshooting is useless.  The only solution is to repair every !@#$ Griplet
on all circuit boards in the TV.
</p><p>
I have repaired these with a high power soldering gun used on both sides with
liberal application of solder and flux.  However, I do not recommend this
shortcut unless you are willing to redo the repair every couple of years.
</p><p>
(From: Mr. Caldwell (jcaldwel@iquest.net).)
</p><p>
There are two methods of repair.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Method 1: Clean the paint from around each griplet on both sides of the
 board to expose the surrounding copper pad. Apply liquid solder flux to the
 cleaned copper.  Solder so as to bridge the griplet to the cleaned copper.
<p>
</p></li><li>Method 2: Do the above but desolder the griplet and place a wire through it
 so that the wire extends beyond the griplet to the copper foil and solder
 the wire on both sides (this was the final fix GE used in this chassis).
<p>
If done carefully Method 1 works and is reliable.
</p><p>
I would normally do this prior to any troubleshooting, it repairs most problems
in this chassis. While you have the board out working on it be sure to also
clean and resolder high temperature components and connections that look bad.
These griplets can be on all boards, even the tuner control board.

</p><h3><a name="tveplmgrp">Erratic problems on late model GE, RCA, or ProScan TV</a></h3>

Problems with bad solder connections, mostly in and around the tuner are very
common with several series of late model (e.g., CTC175/176/177 chassis)
RCA/GE/Proscan TVs.  Ignoring these erratic and intermittent problems can lead
to serious damage including failure of the EEPROM and possibly other expensive
ICs.  Therefore, it is essential to deal with the solder connections as soon
as these symptoms appear.  The repairs are straightforward though perhaps
tedious.  Thomson may reimburse for reasonable cost of repairs.
<p>
Some of the common symptoms include:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Random power cycling.  It may come on in the middle of the night!
</li><li>Picture shifts or changes size vertically or horizontally.
</li><li>Picture turns to snow or shows other reception problems.
</li><li>Picture turns to random display of time or other data.
</li><li>Noisy or muted sound, volume buttons have no effect.
</li><li>Remote has no or unexpected effect.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3><a name="tvsmpns">Sylvania/Magnavox/Philips - no startup</a></h3>

Check the resistor supplying initial base current to the horizontal driver
(not HOT) transistor.  On many chassis, it is R502, 47 K.  It opens for not
good reason.  Why it fails is a mystery as its power rating should be adequate.

<h3><a name="tvsonyhstat">Sony TVs/monitors and Hstat</a></h3>

Symptoms are that the TV or monitor will shut down possibly after a warmpup
period.  There can be other causes but failure of the Hstat module HV sense
wire is quite likely on many Sony models.
<p>
(From: Mr. Beanz (slin01@mail.orion.org).)
</p><p>
If you've determined that the HV is fine, and the H-STAT is shutting
down for no reason, it's possible to bypass.  There is a little brown
wire coming out the bottom of the H-STAT which goes to a 3-pin
connector.  Two wires have a jumper, and the brown wire goes to the
other.  Snip the brown wire at the H-STAT and the TV will continue to
function normally.  Measuring the regulated B+ to the flyback will give
you a pretty good indication of the condition of the HV output.  If it
remains steady at rated voltage (I forget what it was, 130V or 135V)
then HV is A-OK.  If it slowly creeps up or is too high to begin with,
you have a problem.  The voltage will normally jump to 150V or so after
HV shutdown is tripped.
</p><p>
Ideally, you should replace the H-STAT in this case.  Although taking
the poor man's route will WORK, you lose any protection in the event
that the HV circuitry should malfunction.

</p><h3><a name="tvmohstat">More on Hstat</a></h3>

(From: Shawn Lin (slin01@mail.orion.org or lin@science.smsu.edu).)
<p>
The H-STAT is a plastic box that sits mounted to the picture tube's
shield.  It's red in color (for every SONY TV that I have owned) and has
a single knob on it.  The flyback's HV output wire goes into the H-STAT
and another HV wire exists the H-STAT and connects to the anode cap on
the picture tube.  It has a dual purpose, horizontal static convergence
(the control adjusts this) and HV overvoltage shutdown protection. 
Chances are, your HV is within spec and the H-STAT is bad, but you
should make sure the regulated voltage to the flyback is steady and
doesn't fluctuate before assuming the H-STAT is bad.
</p><p>
H-STAT is expensive, and may not be worth replacing.  My kV-1952RS is old and
as a whole, not worth the cost of a new H-STAT, so I just bypassed it and
didn't bother replacing it.  The TV's been working great for over a year and
the picture is still excellent.
</p><p>
Note: On some models, the sense wires need to be connected during startup
or else it will never come on.
</p><p>
CAUTION: On some monitors (like the Sony CPD1302), the sense signal may be
used for actual HV regulation.  Thus, if the sense wire is disconnected, (or
the divider inside the Hstat block fails open) there is no feedback and it is
possible for the high voltage (and probably B+) to increase until the HOT
(and possible other components) blow.  I do not know if this applies to Sony
built TVs as well.

</p><h3><a name="tvnvolmst">No video on late model Sony TVs</a></h3>

(From: David Kuhajda (dkuhajda@locl.net).)
<p>
This following assumes that the more basic TV troubleshooting has already
been performed and resulted in no solution - i.e., filaments are lit up,
CRT voltages are all correct but the cathodes are all in cutoff, main power
supply voltages are present, etc
</p><p>
The 3 most common causes of no video, but good audio are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>AKB blanking due to either a fault in the AKB circuit or the CRT has
 one gun that is too weak and the AKB won't unblank the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Loss of vertical deflection.  The system control must see the vertical
 return pulse to unblank the video.
<p>
</p></li><li>Loss of data bus communication with the Jungle IC.  The Jungle IC must
 send the all OK signal to the micro before it will unblank the video.
</li></ol>
<p>
To troubleshoot:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Try changing the volume with the volume control.  If it changes the
 data bus is not the problem.  This is assuming the TV is tuned to a good TV
 station.
<p>
</p></li><li>Mark the EXACT position of the screen/G2 control with a marker.  Then
 turn the G2 control up.
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>If the picture unblanks and a gray scale bar pattern is used, you can
  usually see which CRT gun is weak.  Time to replace the CRT for a long term
  fix.  All of the temporary fixes I have tried resulted in only a few months
  extra life out of the tube.
<p>
 </p></li><li>If the picture does not unblank and it looks kind of like there is a
  halo near the top of the screen.  The vertical circuit needs checked for
  proper operation and repaired.  WARNING do not continue to operate the TV
  set in this mode for any length of time, it will crack the CRT from
  localized heating!!!! (because the guns are shooting into the extreme top
  of the tube and possible the neck of the tube)
  RETURN the G2 control to the exact position that was marked before you
  started.
 </li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
The typical failure mode of the vertical circuit in a Sony causes only
one of the vertical supply resistors to open usually.  Either the +15 V or
-15 V. This puts a full + or -15 V on the yoke which deflects the guns into
the glass envelope of the tube.

<h3><a name="tvaihxray">An informal history of X-ray protection</a></h3>

(The following is from: Marty).
<p>
Most of the old tube type color TV sets used a shunt HV regulator tube,
usually a 6BK4. If it failed, or some component in the HV circuit failed, the
high voltage, normally 25kV, could go up to 35kV or more, causing some X-Ray 
leakage from the CRT. In the early 70s when news of this radiation scare was 
first announced, there was a public outcry to immediately fix the problem. The 
feds hastily imposed a requirement on manufacturers of TV sets to somehow 
render a TV set "unwatchable" if the HV exceeded rated limits.
</p><p>
The manufacturers first response was to follow the letter of the law and the 
first "HEW" circuit simply blanked the video when the HV exceeded a setpoint 
to make the set "unwatchable".
</p><p>
It was quickly noticed that the HV was not turned off with this circuit and 
the CRT still could emit some radiation. Many TV sets with this feature were
left on  so the consumer could listen to the sound, so the feds tightened the 
requirement.
</p><p>
By this time new TV sets were all solid state and some manufacturers
experimented with HV shutdown circuits, but most of these circuits were poorly 
designed and not reliable.
</p><p>
Zenith thought they had the answer by regulating the HV with a bank of 5 
capacitors across the horizontal output transistor to "hold down" the HV to 
25kV. If one capacitor opened, the HV would only rise about 2kV, not a 
dangerous situation. This wasn't good enough for the feds.
</p><p>
The "fix" that Zenith finally came out with, was a "4 legged capacitor". Two 
legs were the emitter return for the horizontal output transistor, &amp; two legs 
were the HV holddown capacitor (the equivalent value of the bank of 5 caps). 
This "fix" was  accepted by HEW and millions of TVs were produced. It worked 
so well, that other manufacturers soon followed the lead (Magnavox, GE, etc.).
</p><p>
Then the worst happened! The 4 legged monsters started failing in a large 
numbers. Not opening completely &amp; not shorting out. They sometimes allowed the 
HV to skyrocket to over 50kV. Some of them even cut the necks off of the CRTs.
</p><p>
Zenith issued a recall on those models with the problem (more than one entire 
model year). After several "improved" versions of the capacitor, the 
problem was fixed but that recall almost bankrupted the company. Other 
companies had failures too, but usually not as dramatic as Zenith's.
</p><p>
Magnavox used the HV holddown capacitor, both single &amp; 4 leg version in 
several 70s era TV sets and is a good candidate for fireworks as well.
</p><p>
(From: Roy J. Tellason (rtellason@pa.net).)
</p><p>
The problem was reputedly due to a capacitor maker substituting a
different (cheaper) material for the one that Zenith originally
specified, leading to the failures.  I can't recall who the cap maker
was (some company in Taiwan?) but remember hearing as to how they were
the ones who ended up having to pay for all those warranty repairs,
including CRT replacements.
</p><p>
(From: Hugh Prescott (hugh345@adams.net).)
</p><p>
The original X-Ray problem was found in some GE tube sets that used a triode
as a shunt high voltage regulator.
</p><p>
As long as the shunt was working properly there was no significant X-Ray
production and the triode was designed to contain the very low KV (soft)
X-Rays it did produce.
</p><p>
It was found that there was a failure mode that allowed the HV to rise and
the increased voltage was enough to generate a stronger (harder) X-Ray that
could exit the shunt tube.
</p><p>
As I recall the most intense area was directed down through the bottom of
the case. One of the comments about it's danger was that the most likely
person to receive significant exposure was the bar tender standing under a
wall mounted set.
</p><p>
I was part of a radiation safety team that inspected a GE plant in Illinois
that produced this chassis in the middle 1960s. As I recall there was no
recommendations for any changes to the production line at the plant to
reduce the exposure levels as there was not a level of radiation present
that required it.
</p><p>
A set was badly misadjusted for us to make some measurements that confirmed
the exposure levels.

</p><h3><a name="tvwitgoop">What is this goop around some electrolytic capacitors and other components?</a></h3>

That goop is probably glue and generally harmless - it is there to hold
down the components aganst vibration.  I have heard of it sometimes
decomposing and shorting stuff out but I doubt you have that problem.
<p>
Therefore, unless you find a bad cap in the focus or related circuit, we
are still looking at a flyback problem.

</p><h3><a name="tvwdflyback">What does the flyback (LOPT) transformer do?</a></h3>

The typical flyback or Line OutPut Transformer (LOPT) consists of two parts:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>A special transformer which in conjunction with the horizontal output
 transistor/deflection circuits boosts the B+ (120 V typical for a TV) of the
 low voltage power supply to the 20 to 30 kV for the CRT as well as provide
 various secondary lower voltages for other circuits.
<p>
 A HV rectifier turns the high voltage pulses into DC and the CRT capacitance
 smooths it.  The HV may be developed from a single winding with many many
 turns of wire or a lower voltage winding and a diode-capacitor voltage
 multiplier.
</p><p>
 The various secondary voltages power the logic, tuner, video signal,
 vertical deflection circuits, and CRT filament.  In fact, with many TV
 designs, the only power not derived from the flyback is for the keep-alive
 circuitry needed to maintain channel memory and provide startup drive to
 the horizontal deflection/high voltage system.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>A voltage divider that provides the focus and screen supplies.  The pots
 are in this divider network - and these things fail resulting poor focus,
 uncontrolled brightness, or fluctuating focus and/or brightness.  A
 total short could also result in failure of other components like
 the horizontal output transistor.  In some TVs, the focus and screen
 divider and/or controls are external to the flyback and susceptible
 to dust and problems particularly on humid days.  The resistance of these
 circuits is so high that dirt or other contamination can easily provide
 a bypass path to ground especially when slightly damp.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvwdflyfail">Why do flyback (LOPT) transformers fail?</a></h3>

While flyback transformers can on occasion be blown due to a failure elsewhere
in the TV or monitor's power supply or deflection circuits, in most cases,
they simply expire on their own.  Why?
<p>
Flybacks are wound with many layers of really really fine wire with really
really thin insulation.  This entire assembly is potted with an Epoxy resin
which is poured in and allowed to cure.
</p><p>
In some ways, these are just short circuits waiting to happen.
</p><p>
Flybacks get hot during use and this leads to deterioration of the insulation.
Any imperfections, nicks, scratches, etc. in the insulation contributes to
failure.  Temperature cycles and manufacturing defects result in fine cracks
in the Epoxy potting material reducing the insulation breakdown particularly
in the area of the high voltage windings, rectifiers, and focus/screen divider
network.
</p><p>
It is amazing they last as long as they do with the stress they are under.
They also physically vibrate to some extent.  A whole bunch of other factors
are also no doubt important.

</p><h3><a name="tvbcthot">Brief comments on testing the HOT</a></h3>

For a TV with no blown fuses that will not start, here are two quicky
checks to see if the HOT is good and has power and drive:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>HOT tests - check across each pair of pins for shorts (preferably removed
 from the circuit board).  No junction should measure less than 50 ohms
 or so.  Lower readings almost certainly indicate a bad HOT.  If in-circuit,
 however, the reading between base and emitter will be near zero due to the
 secondary of the driver transformer.  See the document:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/semitest.htm">Basic Testing of Semiconductor Devices</a>.  Don't be
 confused by internal damper diodes and B-E resistors.
<p>
</p></li><li>Power - measure across the collector to emitter with a multimeter (with
 the HOT removed or if there is no deflection, this is safe with it in
 place).  There should be solid B+ - typically about 100 to 160 V (115
 VAC sets - possibly higher for 220 VAC sets).  If this is missing, iether
 there is a problem with the power supply or the emitter fusable resistor
 has blown (probably in addition to the HOT) and there is no return.
<p>
</p></li><li>Drive: put an oscilloscope on the base - there should be pulses around
 0.7 V for most of the scan (~50 microseconds) and probably going negative
 a couple volts at least for retrace (~12 microseconds).  If drive is weak
 or missing, determine how startup is implemented as there may be a problem
 in the startup power supply or deflection IC.
</li></ul>
<p>
WARNING: use an isolation transformer for the oscilloscope tests (and whenever
you are probing a TV in general)!!!  This part of the circuit, in particular,
is usually line connected.  See the sections on safety.

</p><h3><a name="tvcrtrejuv">CRT rejuvenation</a></h3>

Where one or more electron guns in the CRT have deteriorated due to wear and
tear, it is sometimes possible to give them a new, but possibly, temporary
lease on life through rejuvenation using a special piece of CRT service
equipment.
<p>
(From: Gary Klechowitz (klechowi@execpc.com).)
</p><p>
When I rejuvenate a tube I inform the customer that there is no warranty on
the job.  Rejuvenating a CRT is like when Clatuu was brought back to life by
Gort in "The Day The Earth Stood Still". When asked "How long will you live"?
he replied: "no one knows".
</p><p>
I use a Sencore Beam Builder. If your tube is just moderately dim and blurry
but still shows good cut off threshold, I would just use the auto restore mode
on the beam builder rather than using the restore button. If the tube is
really bad with little or no cutoff threshold, then the rejuvenator is needed
but that has less than a 50% chance of fixing the tube and in many cases the
tube gets worse to trashed in the process.

</p><h3><a name="tvmemchip">Memory chips in TVs</a></h3>

(From: Mark Zenier (mzenier@eskimo.com or  mzenier@netcom.com).)
<p>
Actually, they are EEPROMs.  A modern TV has integrated the circuitry
so that the microprocessor that controls it also sets the various
adjustments like vertical height and other characteristics.  The same
memory that knows what channels are valid and what the brightness and
other user adjustable settings are is used for factory adjustments that
are set when the TV is first turned on.  It's a lot cheaper to use the
remote control signals that are already there than add a handful of
trimmer resistors.
</p><p>
For service purposes there is often a magic key sequence used with your
remote control to access a service page in the on screen display than
can change these.  Since you can easily set something that could fry the
various high power deflection circuits, getting a little too curious can
void your warranty, and toast your set.

</p><h3><a name="tvhdpipw">How does Picture-In-Picture (PIP) work?</a></h3>

A separate video input or tuner provides the PIP baseband signal which is then
resized and stored in a frame buffer large enough to hold the X and Y
dimensions of the PIP image.  Readout is timed to place the PIP image in the
selected area of the screen and it is substituted for the main video.  What
could be simpler?!

<h3><a name="tvtnscdgc">Tony's notes on setting convergence on delta gun CRTs</a></h3>

(This section from: ard12@eng.cam.ac.uk (A.R. Duell))
<p>
The older delta-gun tubes (3 guns in a triangle, not in a line) can give 
**excellent** pictures, with very good convergence, provided:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>You've set those 20-or-so presets correctly - a right pain as they 
 interact to some extent.
<p>
</p></li><li>The CRT is set up in the final position - this type of tube is more 
 sensitive to external fields than the PIL type.
</li></ol>
<p>
Both my delta-gun sets (a B&amp;O 3200 chassis and a Barco CDCT2/51) have 
very clearly set out and labeled convergence panels, and you don't need a 
service manual to do them. The instructions in the Barco manual are 
something like:
</p><p>
"Apply crosshatch, and adjust the controls on the convergence board in 
the numbered order to converge the picture. The diagrams by each control 
show the effect".
</p><p>
Here's a very quick guide to delta gun convergence where the settings are
done using various adjustments on the neck of the CRT (if you don't have a 
service manual but do know what each control does, and where they all are -
otherwise, follow the instructions in the service manual --- sam): 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Apply a white crosshatch or dot pattern to the set. Don't try and 
 converge on anything else - you'll go insane. It's useful to be able to 
 switch between those 2 patterns.
<p>
</p></li><li>Before you start, set the height, width, linearity, pincushion, etc. They
 will interact with the convergence. Also check PSU voltages, and the EHT
 voltage if it's adjustable. That's where you do need a service manual, I 
 guess.
<p>
</p></li><li>Turn off the blue gun using the A1 switch, and use the red and green 
 static radial controls to get a yellow crosshatch in the middle of the 
 screen. These controls may be electrical presets, or may be movable 
 magnets on the radial convergence yoke (the Y-shaped think behind the 
 deflection yoke).
<p>
</p></li><li>Turn on the blue gun and use the 2 blue static controls (radial and 
 lateral) to align the blue and yellow crosshatches at the center of the 
 screen. Some manufacturers recommend turning off the green gun when doing 
 this, and aligning red with blue (using *only* the blue controls, of 
 course), but I prefer to align blue with yellow, as it gives a check on 
 the overall convergence of the tube.
<p>
</p></li><li>Turn off the blue gun again. Now the fun starts - dynamic convergence. 
 The first adjustments align the red and green crosshatches near the edges - 
 I normally do the top and bottom first. There will be 2 controls for 
 this, either a top and a bottom, or a shift and a linearity. The second 
 type is a *pain* to do, as it's not uncommon for it to affect the static 
 convergence. 
<p>
</p></li><li>Getting the red and green verticals aligned near the edges is a 
 similar process. 
<p>
</p></li><li>You now have (hopefully) a yellow crosshatch over the entire screen. 
<p>
</p></li><li>Now to align the blue. This is a lot worse, although the principle is 
 the same. Turn on the blue gun again, and check the static (center) 
 convergence
<p>
</p></li><li>To align the blue lines with the yellow ones, you'll find not only 
 shift controls, but also slope controls. Use the shift controls to align 
 the centers of the lines and the slope controls to get the endpoints 
 right. These interact to some extent. You'll need to fiddle with the 
 controls for a bit to work out what they do, even if you have the manual.
</li></ol>
<p>
The convergence over the entire screen should now be good....
</p><p>
A word of warning here... The purity is set by ring magnets on almost all 
colour CRTs, but on PIL tubes, there are other ring magnets as well - 
like static convergence. Make sure you know what you are adjusting.

</p><p>
As you probably know, a colour TV produces a red picture, a green picture 
and a blue picture on the screen at the same time. You eyes interpret 
that as a coloured picture. If you look at (a normal, non-projection) TV 
screen through a magnifying lens, you should be able to see red, green 
and blue dots, and no other colours. 
</p><p>
Now, there are 3 basic adjustments to getting a good colour picture : 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Purity. This means that the red picture is only red, the green picture 
 only green, etc. This is the one that needs setting up on your set - you 
 have a purity problem
<p>
</p></li><li>Convergence. This means that the 3 pictures line up over the entire 
 screen (or as much of it as possible). If this one is wrong, you'll see 
 coloured fringes around objects in the picture.
<p>
</p></li><li>Grey scale. This sets the overall colour of the picture - it means 
 that white is really white, etc. It varies the relative intensities of 
 the red, green and blue pictures.

</p><p>
Argh... Here's what should have been done IMHO.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>The set should have been degaussed (a fancy word for demagnetized).
<p>
</p></li><li>They should have connected a 'pattern generator' to the set. This is a 
 piece of equipment that generates various test signals. They should have 
 selected 'red raster' (which will appear to you as a pure red screen), 
 and set up the purity adjustments on that. You should ask to see the pure 
 red raster (and pure green and pure blue if the generator will allow it), 
 and make sure there are no strange-coloured patches. If you like, you can 
 examine the screen through a magnifying lens to check that there are no 
 dots of other colours appearing - I do that when I'm setting up a new TV 
 or monitor.
<p>
</p></li><li>They should then have displayed a 'cross hatch' on the screen. This is 
 a grid of white vertical and horizontal lines. Convergence errors are 
 shown by the lines splitting into 2 or more colours (normally one of the 
 'primary colours' - red, green, or blue, and its complementary colour 
 (cyan, magenta, and yellow).) Note, however, that it's _very_ difficult 
 or even impossible to get perfect convergence over the entire screen on a 
 modern tube, and that you'll not notice small errors near the corners 
 on a TV screen. Note that some engineers prefer to set up the convergence 
 on some other type of display (dots, for example), but you should at 
 least be able to see a cross hatch pattern (all pattern generators 
 provide that one)
<p>
</p></li><li>They should have then displayed a 'grey scale' test display. This is a 
 pattern of vertical grey bars of different brightnesses, from black to 
 white. They should all have been a neutral grey, without colouration.
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that convergence and purity interact to some extent, and thus if 
either is adjusted, both must be checked (and rechecked). Grey scale 
adjustments interact with nothing else.
</p><p>
I would want to see the set on a pattern generator (at least the patterns 
I've mentioned above) and identify the problems.

</p><p>
I've never heard of that - the correct procedure is to wipe the coil 
around the front, top, sides and bottom _NOT the back_ and then move it 
2-3m from the set before turning it off. It doesn't matter whether the 
set is on or off for this, btw. I've not heard of putting a large coil

<p>
The convergence and purity are set by ring magnets on the neck of the 
tube. It's possible that the degaussing procedure has slightly 
demagnetized these, and if so, the whole set will need to be set up. 
Similarly, if any part of the set was magnetized at the factory, then the 
adjustments may have been set up to compensate, and then after 
demagnetization, they'll need to be reset.

</p><h3><a name="tvliqcfptv">Liquid coupling fluid for projection TVs</a></h3>

(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).) 
<p>
The liquid serves two purposes:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>It conducts the heat away from the surface of the tiny picture tube.
<p>
</p></li><li>It couples the light from the glass surface of the picture tube to
 the glass surface of the projection lens. Using air instead of liquid
 would give too much unwanted refraction at the glass-air interfaces
</li></ol>
<p>
I believe that the composition of the liquid is mostly water + glycol,
quite similar to the anti-freeze liquid in your car's radiator, but
without the colorants added that should warn you against drinking it.
</p><p>
A good replacement kit contains not only a plastic bottle of liquid
but also new rubber sealing rings to keep it in, where it belongs.
It's always recommended to buy the original stuff, if you can find it.
</p><p>
(From: markmtf@earthlink.net).
I just wanted to throw my $.02 in since I was one of the original members of
the design team for the first Magnavox and Sylvania PTVs.
</p><p>
I don't recall the models, but essentially, there are several generations
of liquid cooled/coupled PTV designs. One type consists of a set of CRTs with
a liquid cell as part of that component. The other type consists of a liquid
cell that directly couples the CRT faceplate to the lens. 
</p><p>
The liquid is a solution of DI (deionized) water and propylene glycol,
with a small amount of surfactant to eliminate bubbles sticking to the
glass and plastic surface. Distilled water can be used. The propylene
glycol is USP grade, not commercial grade for clarity reasons. You need to
order this through a lab supply company and specify USP grade. If you use
a cheaper grade, the solution may become cloudy. The mixture of your
solution should be somewhere between 50/50 to 80/20 water/glycol. The are
many kinds of surfactant which can cause cloudiness or foaming. You should
probably leave this step out if you are just adding rather than replacing
liquid. If you want to experiment, you might try some fluid from a
photographer darkroom supply store that is used for eliminating water
marks during the film drying process. Just add a few drops to 1/2 liter.
Then heat it up to check for cloudiness. If it works, then you are in
business. Again, if you are careful with filling the cell so that you
don't mix in air, you probably don't need any surfactant.
</p><p>
I probably can't help you too much on the seals or gaskets. It is very
dependent on the specific model. Both types of liquid cells loose the
liquid over time due to vapor traveling through the silicone seals. The
CRTs with the cooling cell used a special RTV for a seal. The CRT/Lens
cooling cell used silicone gaskets. There is a tradeoff on how tightly the
gaskets can be tightened down due to CRT specifications. Some
manufacturers were also working on a expandable chamber to reduce buildup
of pressure when the liquid expanded due to heat. The higher the pressure,
the faster the liquid would evaporate through the gaskets.

<h3><a name="tvbfdfps">Blue focus different for projection sets?</a></h3>

On some 3-tube projection sets, you may find the blue tube to have poorer
focus than red and green.  Don't touch it!
<p>
(From: Dakuhajda (dakuhajda@aol.com).)
</p><p>
What you are describing is completely normal.  The manufactures design in the
blue picture tube so that it will not focus completely. 
</p><p>
In fact the service literature lists exactly how much and which way it should
be out of focus.  In fact the picture generally looks better with the blue CRT
slightly out of focus per specification - slightly wider than the scan lines
so that it completely fills in the scan lines. The slight out of focus is
designed to blend in the scan lines so they are not as noticeable on the
big screen.
</p><p>
This is because when the standard TV signal with 262.5 lines being displayed
at any given time, it looks bad to see the scan lines. The standard TV signal
was never designed to be viewed on a screen larger than 25". 
</p><p>
It also is the nature of the phosphor that makes blue not to allow a good
focus.  Especially in the older sets.  I have not seen any early blue
projection tubes focus well even when they were new.

<p>
 What are the possible causes of doming?  I have noticed that the magnitude of 
 the doming effect varies with TV orientation even after degaussing several
 times at the new orientation.  Does this help identify the cause of the
 doming in my case?"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(Portions from: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
The problem with regular shadow masks is 'doming'. Due to the inherent
principle of shadow masks, 2/3 or more of all beam energy is dissipated
in the mask. Where static bright objects are displayed, it heats up several
hundred degrees. This causes thermal expansion, with local warping of the
mask. The holes in the mask move to a different place and the projections
of the electron beams will land on the wrong colours: purity errors.
The use of invar allows about 3 times more beam current for the same
purity errors.
</p><p>
Both local doming and magnetic fields compete for the remaining landing
reserve. Due to improper degaussing, the doming problem may be more visible.
And applying a tube designed for the wrong hemisphere may very well increase
the doming complaints.  It is possible to deliberately offset the nominal
landing in order to get more doming reserve (the shift due to doming is
always to the outside of the tube).  You would do this using spoiler magnets
put in the right places.
</p><p>
Permanently setting the contrast lower is not a real cure because the customer
might not like such a dark picture. A better picture tube (Invar shadow mask)
*is* a good cure (in most cases) but there is the cost price increase.  (This
is mainly due to the fact that Invar metal is harder to etch.)

</p><h3><a name="tvainsontv">About instant-on TVs</a></h3>

Most TVs built since, say, 1980 have only the microcontroller
powered from a small transformer when the set is off.  This permits the
remote control or front panel pushbutton to switch the set on.  This circuitry
should be no more prone to catastrophic failure than what is in a VCR or
digital clock.
<p>
Historically, there were 'instant on' TVs which kept a substantial portion
of their circuitry live all the time - especially those using vacuum tubes
in at least part of the circuitry (other than the CRT).  In these, there
was a lot more to fail.  Those tubes would continue to change their
characteristics for many minutes when warming up.  Circuits were also much more
touchy - remember all that constant tweaking!  Thus, it made sense from
the users's perspective to eliminate the warmup period and keep those tubes
toasty all the time.
</p><p>
In modern solid state TVs, the only component to really need a warmup period
is the CRT.  All this means is that you have to wait 20 seconds for
the picture to appear.

</p><h3><a name="tvaguwatva">About gadgets to use house wiring as TV antenna</a></h3>

Note that these $10 devices usually contain a single 5 cent ceramic capacitor
as their 'sophisticated electronic circuitry'.  The rest of the fancy plastic
case is just for show.
<p>
(The following is from: Greg Smith (LiveTV@en.com).)
</p><p>
Most people mistakening believe that the larger the antenna the better
the received signal.  The truth of the matter is that each element of
the antenna must be cut to a precise length depending upon the
frequency of the signal you are attempting to receive.  Further more,
each element must also be spaced a precise distance away from the
others.  This creates what is commonly called a "directional array".
(see diagram below) By providing enhanced reception (gain) in the
direction the antenna is pointed, it also provides decreased reception
from the sides and back. (directivity)  This prevents "ghosting" which
is caused by the same signal arriving at the TV at a slightly
different time because the signal bounced off of some structure on
it's way to your set.
</p><p>
If you use the house wiring as the antenna, the length will be random
and the orientation to the received signal will also be random.
Therefore it will pickup the bounced/reflected signals just as well as
the primary signal.  IE: lots of ghosting = very poor picture quality.
</p><p>
Any kind of directional antenna, even a small one, whether inside or
outside, should provide a superior quality picture to that from the
device you are talking about.  Even a cheap "rabbit ear" antenna
mounted on top of the set allows you to orient it in the best
direction.
</p><p>
If you only receive the VHF channels (2-10) in your area then buy a
VHF ony antenna.  If you only receive the UHF (19-60+) then buy a UHF
only.  If you get some of each then make sure that it is a combination
antenna. If your set has separate inputs for VHF/UHF make sure you
also get one with the proper splitter.

<h3><a name="tvciasvideo">Can I add an S-Video input to my TV or VCR?</a></h3>

Possibly, but why bother?  You will most likely be limited by the TV or VCR's
circuitry anyhow.
<p>
All S-Video means is (1) a special connector and (2) separate luminance (Y) and
chrominance (C) rather than composite video.
</p><p>
In a VCR, you will need to bypass the input circuitry and get to the place
where Y and C are separate.  This may or may not be possible depending on its
design.
</p><p>
In a TV, they may never be separate and you will need to substitute your own
circuitry for the chroma demodulator.
</p><p>
It is probably not worth it as you will likely not gain much in picture quality
but if you really are determined, a schematic will be essential in either case.
</p><p>
If all you want to do is allow for an S-video input, there are single chips
which will combine the Y and C into a normal composite video signal.
</p><p>
Also, see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvhdiaavio">How do I add A/V inputs or outputs
to a TV which does not have them built in?</a> since there may be safety
implications in the case of adding S-Video to a TV without any A/V jacks.

</p><h3><a name="tvhdiaavio">How do I add A/V inputs or outputs to a TV which does not have them built in?</a></h3>

For A/V inputs (video and audio) The place to do this is after the video
and audio IF where baseband signals are normally separate.
<p>
For audio, in particular, an alternative is to tap into the audio circuitry
which may be elsewhere.  Even the loudspeaker outputs can be used but then
without additional switching, you cannot disable the internal speakers when
you are using your stereo system.
</p><p>
Depending on the model of TV, doing any of this may be trivial to impossible -
or a serious safety hazard.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Trivial: many low-end models use the same chassis (read this: circuit board)
 as the high end A/V receivers.  Either there will be some parts missing,
 a cable connection to the missing A/V panel, or a missing auxiliary board
 which would have the A/V interface and jacks.  If this is the case with
 your model, then it should be straightforward and safe to tap into the
 circuits at that point.
<p>
 A service manual or Sams' Photofact for the set will probably even identify
 the additional circuitry present in the higher priced models with A/V inputs.
</p><p>
 If, on the other hand, everything is crammed onto a single circuit board
 with no evidence of A/V signals, it may be very difficult as suitable
 tap-in points may simply not be available.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Hazardous: many TVs have circuitry which is not isolated from the AC line.
 If this is the case with your set, then it may be more trouble than it is
 worth to provide the essential isolation barrier between the TV and your
 external A/V equipment.  The only 'easy' solution for audio at least is to
 include an isolation transformer RATED FOR LINE VOLTAGE ISOLATION in each
 signal path to the outside world.  A means of isolation can be provided for
 video as well but it has to be able to handle the 6 MHz or so bandwidth of
 the video signal.  A simple capacitor even if rated for sufficient voltage
 will probably not work and could be hazardous since it would need to have a
 high uF value to pass the lower frequency end of the video signal.
</li></ul>
<p>
If what you are really after is replacing a dead tuner/IF with your own tuner
or converter, this may be possible but, again, may not be worth the trouble.
The antenna isolation circuitry is probably external to the TV's tuner so
yours could be substituted in its place.  Of course, any user contact with the
transplanted device would then have to be TOTALLY prevented since a serious
shock hazard would be present for all metal parts and connections including
shield grounds.  In addition, many components would likely blow the instant
power was applied if this were not done perfectly.
</p><p>
Unless you intend to always use the direct A/V inputs and forgo the tuner,
you will need some way of selecting between them - a switch or relay.
This could be manual - you push a button or flip a switch - or automatic.
There are all kinds of ways to doing the detection - mechanical, checking
for a low impedance connection, looking for a signal, using a switch, etc.
</p><p>
You will need a schematic - don't attempt this without one (for safety, if
no other reason).  Even some TVs that have A/V jacks use a live chassis and
provide isolation for each signal (though this is the exception rather than
the rule).  So, even adding another A/V jacks to one of these would be
hazardous!

</p><h3><a name="tvciadrgbi">Can I add direct RGB inputs to a TV?</a></h3>

The signals going into the CRT neck board are separate RGB, possibly a
somewhat higher voltage level, but otherwise similar to those sent to a
computer monitor.  So, would it be possible to bypass the tuner and color
decoding and go direct for better picture quality?  After all, RGB SCART
inputs are common on PAL TVs.
<p>
Assuming the scan rate of your source is NTSC (or PAL as appropriate), in
principle, yes.  The RGB signals may have to be amplified from the normal
.7 to 1 V p-p used for monitors to whatever is required by your TV's final
video amps (unless you can find a location on the mainboard where the levels
are lower) and composite sync would need to be injected separately.
</p><p>
However, there are some serious safety issues.  Many TV are designed with
a chassis that is electrically live - not isolated from the AC line so unless
an isolation transformer is used to power the TV or some means of isolation
is used in the coupling of the signals, you could end up with a very shocking
situation and/or blown parts all over the place.  I wouldn't recommend it
unless you have the complete schematics and really know what you are doing.

</p><p>
Greetings. But of course... The cost is $9-ish per set and it includes a 9
foot (yup, 9 foot) cable and a handy, in-line volume control. The setup
requires an audio output somewhere on the TV itself - is there a headphones
jack? If yes, all you need is a "Y" (splitter) and two sets of headphones.
If not, hmmm.... Either you or the local TV repair shop will need to add one.
Depending on the circuitry of the speaker amplifier inside the TV, this may
be as easy as splicing in a headphone jack and drilling a hole for it on the
case, or as hard as somehow matching the impedance of the speaker to that of
the headphones. You *will* need to look at the schematic or measure the
speaker/signal.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvhdiaavio">How do I add A/V

<p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
It won't blow up your workbench but the differences are probably significant
enough that the performance would be unsatisfactory if it worked at all.
</p><p>
In addition, this may blow up the power supply board - kill the horizontal
output transistor and/or low voltage power supply itself - as the required
power levels are higher.  If you have nothing to lose, power your Frankenstein
initially through a series 100 W light bulb and Variac.  Then you will be able
to tell if you are even close with less risk of blowing expensive parts.
</p><p>
Of course, this does assume that all the organs your are merging are actually
good to start with.  Why do you you think they unloaded those TV carcasses?

</p><h3><a name="tvtoscope">Turning a TV (or monitor) into an oscilloscope?</a></h3>

This question comes up so often and it does sound like a neat project to
give a defunct TV a second life.  Don't expect to end up with a Tek 465
on the cheap when you are done.  However, it could be a fun learning
experience.
<p>
CAUTION: See the safety recommendations below.
</p><p>
You will be severely limited in the performance of such a scope.  TVs and
monitors are designed to operate at a very narrow range of horizontal scan
rates and the high voltage is usually derived from the horizontal deflection.
So, you would need to retain the original deflection system for this purpose
at least.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>You will need to disconnect the deflection yoke from the horizontal and
 vertical deflection circuits of the TV or monitor without killing the HV.
 (also, doing all this without killing yourself as well).  Depending on
 the design, this may be as simple as unplugging the yoke connector.  More
 than likely, you will need to substitute a load for the horizontal
 deflection coil. A coil from another sacrificial similar TV or monitor
 would probably suffice.
<p>
 Warning: at this point you have a really bright spot in the middle of the
 screen which will turn to a really black spot if the brightness is not turned
 way down really really quickly.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>For the horizontal, you need a ramped current source.  You are driving
 a non-ideal inductor (the deflection coil) so it has both inductance and
 resistance.  Thus the waveform is a trapezoid - a voltage ramp (for the
 resistive part) superimposed on a voltage step (for the inductive part).
 This should not be too difficult.  Don't expect to be able to achieve
 really fast sweep.  Even running at normal TV rates is non-trivial.
<p>
</p></li><li>Similarly, for the vertical you need to drive with a voltage (your signal)
 controlled current source. However, if you are just screwing around, then
 the linearity etc. for the vertical may not be that important.  In this
 case, one way is to put a current sensing resistor in series with the
 deflection coil and use this in a power op amp type of feedback
 arrangement.  (You could do this for (2) as well.

</p></li><li>There is a good chance that the original brightness control will work
 as an intensity adjustment.  However, with some TVs and monitors, this
 depends on receiving a valid video signal.  You may need to improvise.
 If you do want to control the intensity from a signal source, you
 should be able to tap into the drive signals going to the little board
 on the neck of the CRT.
<p>
</p></li><li>Don't expect high bandwidth, uniform response, or any of the other
 things you take for granted with a decent scope.  That takes work.
 However, as a fun project, this certainly qualifies.  Interchanging
 the functions of the horizontal and vertical deflection yoke (and
 rotating it 90 degrees) may provide a better match of horizontal
 and vertical bandwidth to your intended applications or experiments.
<p>
</p></li><li>With a color TV or monitor, these experiments could be quite interesting
 and educational but there may be color fringing effects since you are not
 compensating for certain aspects of dynamic convergence at all.
<p>
</p></li><li>SAFETY: Once you disconnect the deflection yoke from the TV or monitor's
 circuits, move the original circuits out of the way and put a barrier
 between between you and the rest of the TV or monitor. All you will need are
 connections to the deflection yoke on the CRT (unless you want to do
 intensity modulation in which case you will need to drive the video
 output(s) to the CRT cathodes.  I would recommend against doing this
 if your unit is one of those with a totally 'live' chassis as there would
 be additional safety hazards and circuit complications).

Hehehe... Actually, I've done this one. :)
</p><p>
I've got two old IBM mainframe terminals, painted like charred metal,
hooked up to each channel of the 'B' speaker outputs on my stereo.  It's
strange looking and always an attention getter when I have guests.  Not
to mention, the long-persistence phosphor they use makes interesting
tracers :)
</p><p>
One caveat, at least on these monitors (I don't know what other monitors
this might apply to).  When you turn them off, the circuitry shuts down
in the following order: horizontal drive first, electron gun second, and
vertical drive last.  Therefore, if there is no vertical deflection,
which would be the case if the stereo is quiet, the active electron beam
becomes perfectly stationary during the course of shutdown, thus burning
a hole in the phosphor.  Oops :)  I found it more effective to hook the
stereo into the HORIZONTAL drive, thus avoiding this problem.  Not quite
like your average oscilloscope.
</p><p>
Another interesting effect -- if the electron gun is active during
vertical blanking interval, it seems to deflect so far that it bounces
off the SIDES of the picture tube, and sprays all over the phosphor,
making some interesting images.

Max Bandwidth was a startling 10 or 15Khz. Enough for elementary audio

Those magazines also published designs for delayed sweep &amp; trigger modules as

</p><p>
(From: Dale H. Cook (dhcook@rev.net).)
</p><p>
Every few months someone will pop up with this question. A TV would not make a
very good scope. Bandwidth would be limited and the amount of work needed to
build the horizontal and vertical amplifiers, sweep and triggering circuits
and so on wouldn't be worth the effort. You'd need even more work to add
modern features such as delayed triggering and variable hold-off. Don't even
think about multiple channels and the advantages they offer. In a time when I
see used Tek 465s offered for $200 it certainly doesn't pay to try to convert
a TV. If you are just looking for a challenging electronic project I can think
of several that have a far better chance of yielding something useful.  Now,
if you were starting with an antique set that used an electrostatic CRT you
might do a bit better, but a 1937 Dumont will set you back about $3,000.00 or
so - a little too much of an investment.

</p><p>
I've worked on the vector monitors that were used on some of the 1970's 
minicomputers. These are essentially X-Y displays (not raster scanned), and
would make audio-bandwidth 'scopes if given a timebase. I would guess at a
bandwidth of the order of 100kHz.
</p><p>
Some of them (DEC, certainly, maybe Tektronix) were electromagnetically 
deflected like a TV. However, there are a couple of things to be aware of.
Firstly, the output amplifier, which drives the yoke at constant current, is
pretty complex. Secondly, the yoke is specially made - the 2 sets of coils are
pretty similar (unlike those in a TV), and the inductance is critical.
</p><p>
So, while I'll keep these monitors running, I'd not want to have to covert a
TV into one :-).

(From: David Katz (DAVEkATZ@prodigy.net).)
</p><p>
If by chance what you want is an X-Y display for audio, not a (more typical)
X-T, it's easy.  Just put a resistor in series with each yoke (about 100 ohms,
5 W) and drive them with a stereo amp.

Your best hope might be to get a older generation heart monitor from a

(From: Alan (revidyks@rocketmail.com).)
</p><p>
Apparently it's pretty hard to produce a decent scope.
</p><p>
It is, however, pretty easy to use the CRT as something like a scope,
which I did recently with the built-in green screen monitor of a thing
called a Kapro 2X. It was being thrown away, so I said I'd take it and
have a look inside before throwing it away.
</p><p>
I wondered what if it was possible to drive the CRT from a source
other than the computer video circuitry, so I did some tests, worked
out how and by what voltage the deflectors were driven, (about 1v, 0.3A
measured as an AC voltage).
</p><p>
Once I'd worked out that this was about the same as the output from a
small stereo amp, I removed the horizontal signal from the CRT and hooked
one channel of my stereo across the horizontal deflector , left
the vertical deflector hooked up to it's (60Hz?, 30Hz?) signal, and switched
it on. The results look pretty good, I get a full-screen moving trace
of the sound wave. One other thing that I did was make the beam intensity
constant by turning a knob marked 'B-SUB' a bit, this would have flooded
the screen with 'white' ordinarily, but was perfect for me as I could now
remove the computer motherboard all together.
</p><p>
I also tried connecting the left and right channels across the horizontal
and vertical deflectors respectively (first disconnecting them from their
normal inputs), which produced some really  cool looking lissijous (sp?)
figure type things, that change and throb with the music- each CD seemed
to have distinctive characteristics. Maybe I'll try two different pieces
of music across the axes, could be interesting...
</p><p>
I'd love to try throwing some different signals of different frequencies
and shapes across the axes too, especially in combination a with musical
one. The 'best' results so far, have been from music with a strong bass,
simple beat (cymbals with a bass drum look great), and not too many layers
of guitars, vocals, etc. (too many sounds and it's an uninteresting mess...)
</p><p>
If you want more information or have any advice on or experience with
this sort of thing, mail me...
</p><p>
If you're thinking of trying any of this, remember (in case you don't know)
that TVs/Monitors can be REALLY dangerous even when switched off and
unplugged.  See the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsaf">SAFETY</a>.

</p><h3><a name="tvdavspos">Displaying a video signal as a picture on an oscilloscope</a></h3>

I am not sure why anyone would really want to do this other than as an
experiment - it would be interesting one.
<p>
If a composite video signal is the input, you will need a sync separator.
</p><p>
You will have to construct a vertical deflection voltage ramp generator
which can be locked to your vertical sync signal.
</p><p>
The horizontal timebase of the scope will be fine for the horizontal
deflection and should easily lock to your horizontal sync pulse or
(if the scope has a TV trigger mode) directly to the video signal.
</p><p>
A video amplifier will be needed if your Z axis does not have an internal
amplifier (you need .7 V p-p to be full brightness range.)  Unless you provide
automatic gain control, this will need to include offset (brightness)
and gain (contrast) adjustments.  Even if there is an internal amplifier, it
may  not have the required bandwidth for the video signal.
</p><p>
However, the overall brightness may be disappointing - a scope is not designed
for overall high brightness.  The beam focus will not be as good as that on
a little TV either.

</p><h3><a name="tvsslinefilt">Use of surge suppressors and line filters</a></h3>

Should you always use a surge suppressor outlet strip or line circuit?
Sure, it shouldn't hurt.  Just don't depend on these to provide protection
under all circumstances.  Some are better than others and the marketing
blurb is at best of little help in making an informed selection.  Product
literature - unless it is backed up by testing from a reputable lab - is
usually pretty useless and often confusing.
<p>
Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone
to spikes or dips.
</p><p>
However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment
already includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C
line filters.  More is not necessarily better but may move the point
of failure to a readily accessible outlet strip rather than the innards
of your equipment if damage occurs.
</p><p>
Very effective protection is possible through the use of a UPS (Uninterruptible
Power Supply) which always runs the equipment off its battery from the internal
inverter (not all do).  This provides very effective isolation power line
problems as the battery acts as a huge capacitor.  If something is damaged,
it will likely be the UPS and not your expensive equipment.  Another option
is to use a constant voltage transformer (SOLA) which provides voltage
regulation, line conditioning, and isolation from power spikes and surges.
</p><p>
It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or
you see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood
(or an impending lightning storm).

</p><h3><a name="tvlightningd">Comments on lightning damage</a></h3>

Unfortunately, lightning or similar surge related damage can happen to any
equipment that is plugged into ANYTHING - AC line, antenna, cable, phone.
Symptoms can be almost anything but often run along the lines of the
following:
<p>
</p><blockquote>
"I just recently bought a new JVC TV, about 5 months ago to be exact.
 A few weeks ago it got hit by lightning. Not directly though. I am
 trying to figure out why it will not power up now. I traced as far as I
 could into the power and it seems to be getting 120 all the way to some
 sort of parts. I know at least that it is going past the fuse, and the
 fuse did not even blow. But when I press the on switch still nothing
 happens. The switch is good, as is the wiring leading to the mainboard.
 From there I don't know. Does anyone know of any VERY common things to go
 when hit by lightning? I really don't know much about TV repair, but I
 feel like trying to fix it myself. I just have no idea where to look
 now. It is getting power, but I don't know where exactly it is stopping.
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Brian Frank" (jambfrank@erols.com).)
</p><p>
When I was in trade school the instructor who taught the TV/VCR.
repair course also had a fixit place on the side. This man knew
everything about TVs, he could almost tell you what was wrong with a
set by just smelling it. Once I brought a set to class that had been
struck indirectly as well, the instructor told me the best thing to do
was to tie a rope around it an use it as an anchor for a boat. He
further went on to explain that a set struck in any way usually has so
many problems that it is not worth getting in to. The one time he did
try to fix a particularly expensive set it took him and two other
employees three weeks to get it going. And he said there were still some
problems.
</p><p>
As for tips on actually fixing it you might want to ask around for junkers
and cannibalize them into one set.

</p><h3><a name="tvgfcitrip">GFCI tripping with TV, monitor, or other high tech equipment</a></h3>

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are very important for
minimizing shock hazards in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors and other
potentially wet areas.  They are now generally required by the NEC Code
in these locations.  However, what the GFCI detects to protect people - an
imbalance in the currents in the Hot and Neutral wires caused possibly
by someone touching a live conductor - may exist safely by design in
high tech electronic equipment.  The result - false tripping - is
mostly a problem with 3 wire grounded devices with built in line filters
having capacitors between Hot and Ground but may also occur with 2 wire
ungrounded TVs due to the power-on surge into the highly capacitive
or inductive loads of their power supplies.
<p>
However, it's also possible for this to happen when a TV is hooked to a cable
system because it's cable shield is connected to Earth ground.  In such a
case, this may or may not be a cause for concern.
</p><p>
TVs using Hot chassis designs couple the antenna and its cable shield to
the tuner with small coupling capacitors.  A side effect is that some AC
leakage current can flow through these capacitors, possibly enough to trip
the GFCI.  If the TV's plug isn't polarized, try reversing it and see if
the problem goes away.  If it is polarized, make sure your outlet is wired
properly and you aren't using a non-polarized extension cord with the TV
plugged reversed.
</p><p>
It's also possible the TV is faulty and the tripping is actually taking
place as a result of a legitimate problem.
</p><p>
To assure the set is safe, (whether reversing the plug helps or not), a
leakage test should really be performed by measuring the AC current between
the TV's antenna shield and an Earth ground.  Try it with both polarities of
the wall plug.  Anything over about 8 mA will trip a GFCI.  If the leakage
current is less than this with either polarity of the wall plug, the GFCI is
overly sensitive.  If the leakage current is much more with either polarity of
the wall plug, the set is defective and should be serviced immediately.  It
should not be used until the problem is corrected as a serious shock hazard
exists.

</p><h3><a name="tvmultisystvs">Multisystem TVs</a></h3>

The question often arise: can my NTSC TV modified to display PAL signals
(or vice-versa).  Unlike a VCR where there are substantial differences
between recording of NTSC and PAL, the problem of displaying the picture
is much simpler.
<p>
The following assumes 525 line NTSC and 625 line PAL:
</p><p>
The horizontal scan rates are nearly identical (15,734 Hz for NTSC and
15,625 Hz for PAL), so this is not likely to be a problem.  If these
differed significantly, then there would be design issues similar to
those for multisync computer monitors and this would drive up cost.
</p><p>
The vertical scan are slightly more of a problem with 525 line/60 Hz
NTSC and 625 line/50 Hz PAL.  But it is a lot easier to design vertical
deflection to accommodate a modest variation in rates.  TVs could be easily
designed or modified to accept either.
</p><p>
The color encoding techniques differ but inexpensive ICs exist that
can deal with either standard.  In fact, many are programmable to
do either with a jumper and slight modifications to the external
components.
</p><p>
Displaying a monochrome - B/W - picture on the other kind of
set is usually possible if the set has a vertical hold control
or enough vertical range.  Modifying the chroma circuitry is
more complicated but it should be possible to substitute a
second IC and patch it into the existing video chain.
</p><p>
As far as commercial multisystem TVs are concerned, the real reason we
do not see many of these (at least in the U.S.) is lack of demand.  They
are available if you look hard enough and are willing to pay a premium.
They are readily available on the international market.

</p><h3><a name="tvntsconpal">Playing NTSC videotape on a PAL TV</a></h3>

Note that you will probably need an adapter at the very least to connect a PAL
TV to an NTSC RF cable.  This, at least isn't a problem as suitable devices
should be readily available for a couple dollars.  However, that may be the
easy part if the VCR doesn't do enough of a conversion!
<p>

<p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
There are 4 possible answers:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>The VCR does not convert an NTSC signal to PAL, it outputs pure NTSC and
 you need an NTSC-compatible TV to view it.
<p>
</p></li><li>The VCR converts NTSC 3.58 to NTSC 4.43 and you need a PAL-TV adapted to
 NTSC 4.43 to view it (relatively minor adaptation).
<p>
</p></li><li>The VCR converts NTSC 3.58 to PAL 4.43 but keeps the field rate at 60 Hz.
 That is definitely not a standard signal!  Some standard PAL-TV's will
 permit viewing it, and some Won't!  At least be prepared to see interesting
 artifacts and crosstalks.
<p>
</p></li><li>Conversion to real standard PAL is very expensive, thus unlikely.
</li></ol>
<p>
The most likely answers are (1) and (3), check the spec of the VCR.  The NTSC
4.43 system has been sold to middle-east and maybe US-military.

There are multi-standard TV's that cover more countries, but a TV that covers

Germany.  England has PAL-I, the analog sound is at a different frequency and
the digital sound is their own variety of Nicam.  France has Secam L-L', mostly
incompatible with anything else.  I don't know about Greece, probably PAL-BG.
Most Philips high-end sets can do PAL-BG, Secam-BG and NTSC (the latter from
the baseband video inputs only).

</p><h3><a name="tvf3dsd">Could a TV be modified for 3D (stereo) display?</a></h3>

The whole idea of stereo 3-D vision to put the left and right views to the
appropriate eyeball.  There are two common ways of doing this:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use different colors for the two views with color filters in from of
 each eye to separate the views.  This is what were often used for
 the really bad (content wise) sci-fi movies of the '50s.
<p>
</p></li><li>Display alternate views on the same monitor screen but use LCD shutter
 glasses to allow each eye to only see the appropriate view.  This requires
 increasing the refresh rate to avoid unacceptable flicker.
</li></ol>
<p>
The first approach can be used with any TV and a pair of monochrome
video cameras.  Of course, true color cannot be used since pure colored
images are needed to separate the stereo views.
</p><p>
Alternating views with synchronized LCD glasses is a possibility but
on a standard TV, the resulting refresh rate would be 30 Hz with a 50%
duty cycle which is likely to be useful only as a short experiment - else
your viewers will likely develop splitting headaches.

</p><h3><a name="tvtvtomon">Displaying TV on a computer monitor</a></h3>

My general recommendation is that if you have the space, buy an inexpensive
TV - the quality in the end may in fact be better.  And, it will be usable
without tying up your expensive monitor and (maybe) PC.
<p>
While various convertors are advertized to use a computer monitor
with video from a VCR or other source, keep in mind that if it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is like the claim of a $200 box for this:
</p><p>
OK, let me get this straight - this card/box will enable a 31.4 kHz horizontal
scan rate monitor (VGA) be used as a TV - yes or no?  It thus includes a video
A/D, full screen frame buffer, D/A, and all the other tuner stuff for under
$200?  I don't think so.  A scan doubler - which is a subset of the above -
will not result in a high quality picture since it will display pairs of
lines interleaved.  Or does the impressive advertisement leave out the
key requirement that the monitor sync at the NTSC horizontal scan rate
of 15.734 kHz (most newer monitor do not)?  Or is it a board that plugs
into a PC and indeed does use the resources of the PC including the VGA
card and bus?
</p><p>
In any case, get a written money back satisfaction guarantee.

</p><h3><a name="tvcvidtotv">Displaying computer video on a TV</a></h3>

Assuming this means NTSC:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You need to convert RGB to NTSC - there are single chips for this.  Try
 Sony, Philips, Motorola, and others.  These will combine the R, G, B,
 H sync, and V sync into a single composite video signal using a minimum
 of additional components.
<p>
</p></li><li>You need to match the scan rate to NTSC - 15.734 kHz horizontal.  Even
 basic VGA is twice this - 31.4 kHz.  If your video card can be programmed
 to put out interlaced NTSC rate video then this is easy.  If not, it is
 more difficult.  If you want to use anything higher res than VGA, it is
 a very non-trivial problem requiring the construction of a scan convertor
 which includes a video A/D, full frame store, interpolator/readout timing,
 video D/A.  Unless you are an experienced digital/analog designer, you
 really do not want to tackle any of this.
</li></ol>
<p>
For the special case of VGA-&gt;NTSC, you may be able to get away with just
storing a single scan line since the horizontal frequency is (almost)
exactly twice the NTSC horizontal of 15.734 kHz.  A double buffer where
one buffer is storing while the other is reading out at approximately half
the VGA pixel rate should work. With appropriate timing, even lines become the
even field for NTSC and odd lines become the odd field (I may have this
backwards).  It is still not a trivial undertaking.  Also, keep in mind
that the quality you will get on NTSC will be poorer than the VGA due to
fundamental NTSC bandwidth limitations.  Also, flicker for line graphics will
be significant due to the interlacing at 30 Hz.  Even this is a non-trivial
undertaking.
</p><p>
The requirements for PAL are very similar.  For 625 lines systems, the
800x600 is the format that most closely matches the TV resolution.
</p><p>
You can also buy little boxes to do this.  Quality is general not great
as you are seriously limited by NTSC/PAL and the VCR.  Except for
presentations on existing TV rate equipment, it is probably not worth
the effort.  This is totally useless for any serious computer applications.
</p><p>
For professional presentations, modern video projectors are available that
use high resolution LCD panels and real-time scan conversion.  However,
they are still relatively expensive).

<p>
It is mostly digital.  The original master signal is digitized and
stored in memory.  Control codes specify the readout of a (probably double
buffered) frame store.  9 and 16 screen versions are common.  If you
look closely, you will note that the resolution of pictures that differ
is always lower indicating that the whole affair is driven from a single
tape source with appropriate decoding.  Where the pictures are the same,
they may be at full resolution.  Sub blocks of identical pictures may be

</p><h3><a name="tvscanvel">What is Scan Velocity Modulation?</a></h3>

(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
<p>
Scan velocity modulation occurs around the transients in the luminance
signal. The beam is sped up just before and just after the edge and it is
slowed down during the edge. This makes for a sharper edge. On an alternating
B/W pattern (stripes, checkerboard) you will see that the white parts get
smaller and the black parts get whiter. This geometry error is a side-effect.
Some say that this is the main intended effect of SVM.
</p><p>
SVM is *supposed* to be used to compensate for the spot blowup at high beam
current. Peaking does not help to improve sharpness because the higher peak
beam current also gives a fatter spot. SVM *can* work in that
case. Unfortunately it is often misapplied, too much SVM will give a very
unnatural picture, with obvious horizontal geometry errors.
</p><p>
If applied properly, SVM can improve the picture. Unfortunately there has been
a rat race, led by Japanese, suggesting that more is better.
</p><p>
Some people will simply advise turning the contrast down. At low beam current
the spot size will be acceptably small and SVM is not needed. In most, if not
all, cases they will disable the SVM circuit, usually by pulling the supply
connector to the SVM panel. That panel is often fixed to the neck of the
picture tube, behind the video amplifier panel.

</p><h3><a name="tvablspp">About Automatic Black Level Stabilization and possible problems</a></h3>

This is how some Philips TVs automatically compensate for component drift.
<p>
(From: Jeroen Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
Check datasheets of TDA4580, TDA4680, TDA4780, TDA8390: 
</p><p>
These video control ICs have automatic black level stabilization.  At the top
of each field it generates 3 measurement lines (R,G,B).  Through a BCI beam
current info wire it measures the beam current.  It adjusts the amplitude of
the measurement pulses so that it gets a fixed current level back, usually
around 10 uA. Actually it measures a delta-voltage, the current is determined
by resistors on the picture tube panel. The result is used as an offset for
the video signals so that black voltage is put at zero beam current.  (3
capacitors near the IC store 3 voltages, a 4th capacitor is used to store an
ultra-black reference to compensate for leakage current.)
</p><p>
The pulses are easily seen on the screen if you turn down the vertical
amplitude (height), you'll see 3 dim lines at the top.
</p><p>
When the set first starts up, the measurement loop can not close because cold
cathodes can not produce any beam current. That would cause the loop to
increase the black level to maximum.  To prevent that, first it is measured
whether the cathodes are warm yet. Instead of the 3 small measurement pulses a
much larger (peak-white level) warm-up pulse is generated. This looks like a
big fat white line at the top (above the screen edge).
</p><p>
The video control IC waits for the beam current to increase (to approx. 5 mA
for the 3 guns together) before it will release the black level control
loop. This is measured over the same BCI line, a diode adds an extra load
resistor to this line so that a large beam current is required to cross the
detection level. After this level is reached (was it +8 or +9 V ?) the
black level stabilization starts, and after almost a second the picture is
unblanked. It should be correct at once.
</p><p>
(I have often argued that this long delay is not pleasing to the customer who
would rather have a faint picture earlier.)
</p><p>
Reasons why the warm-up trip level may not be reached are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The pulse is not strong enough, sometimes it can be adjusted via the same
 pin on the IC that adjusts the peak drive limiter,
<p>
</p></li><li>The emission of the cathodes is not enough (too cold, worn out cathode
 surface or too low VG2 voltage = screen voltage),
<p>
</p></li><li>The measurement resistor is too low value (via that diode),
<p>
</p></li><li>The beam current info circuit at the video output amplifiers does not work
 well, often because the CRT cathode voltage goes too low and the voltage on
 BCI can not be higher than that. 
</li></ul>
<p>
If there is too little beam current in general then I would start with
re-adjusting the VG2 screen voltage. Because of the automatic black level
stabilization this will NOT have any obvious effect on the picture. The
stabilization just follows the VG2.
</p><p>
If VG2 is too low then the peak drive limiter will kick in too early and you
can't get a decent contrast. Also the picture will be less sharp because at a
lower cutoff voltage a smaller cathode area is used plus there's your problem
with the warm-up detector.
</p><p>
If VG2 is too high then the video signal can not achieve blanking level
anymore and you will see retrace lines. Also the cathodes will wear out faster
because at a higher cutoff voltage a smaller cathode area is used, you'll have
a sharper picture but not for long.
</p><p>
The proper adjustment procedure for VG2 is in the service doc, you need to
observe the measurement pulses on an oscilloscope.  But a little twist won't
hurt too much, especially if you have already written off the CRT.
</p><p>
(I have the advantage of having known the people who invented this system many
years ago, they were once my teachers.)

</p><h3><a name="tvkellfact">What is Kell factor with respect to interlaced displays?</a></h3>

(The following is from Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com).)
<p>
The Kell factor - which has to do with the fact that we're often undersampling
an image from the standpoint of the Gospel According to St. Nyquist - IS
a factor in the reduction of vertical resolution, but interlacing plays
a part as well.  This comes from at least two factors:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>The receiver usually cannot precisely interleave the two fields.
<p>
</p></li><li>More importantly, there are steps taken to reduce the interline flicker
 which reduce the effective vertical resolution.  This includes running the
 line width of the display somewhat larger than would otherwise be the case,
 and in interlaced cameras, discharging the entire screen (including the
 lines from the "other" field) after every field scanned.
</li></ol>
<p>
Interlace is particularly troublesome on moving images, where you will often
perceive momentarily "missing" details.  There was a LOT of discussion
regarding the gory details of interlacing in the recent HDTV debates within
SMPTE and other groups.

</p><h3><a name="tvhmvchip">Homemade V-chip (or at least viewing limiter)</a></h3>

Here is an interesting questions:
<blockquote>
"I would like a control box of some sort that controls the cable
 signal that comes into the TV. I want to be able to control the total
 time a particular child has in his account to watch, plus the actual
 channels that he is allowed to watch (no Playboy or MTV), PLUS the
 time of day that he can watch (not during home work
 time). Programmable by channel, cumulative time, hour of the day, and
 day of the week. I also need a master pass word for parental
 programming of the kids accounts, plus be able to watch what I want to
 at any time.  The kids could use either an individual account number
 or an individual "card" of some kind with a PIN like our ATM cards.
 This "box" should be secure so that a 14 year old boy can't bypass it
 very easily. At least without doing come major damage so that I'd know
 it when he did it. I know that this is a lot to ask, but I'm very
 familiar with computer programming and chipset technology, I do know
 that such a thing can be done. I just don't have the electronics
 knowledge to do it."
</blockquote>
<p>
The following probably won't help you build such a gizmo but here
are some thoughts:
</p><p>
First, I would not attempt to build any of the RF/cable switching
stuff - there are too many variations.  I would suggest trying to
control the control of what you have.  With a cable box, this would be 
relatively easy - just put the box and an IR transmitter in the same
sealed enclosure.  If you have only a cable ready TV, you could substitute
or intercept the remote detector signal inside the set and disable
the front panel controls.
</p><p>
Then you need:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>An input devices - keypad for example.
<p>
</p></li><li>A display - a 1 line LCD.
<p>
</p></li><li>A microprocessor.  This doesn't need to be much - just to store the
 'account information' including balance, allowable channel and time
 slot map, passwords.  It would need a real time clock.
<p>
</p></li><li>An IR remote code transmitter.  This could probably be directly
 programmed by the micro to control your cable box.
</li></ul>
<p>
Each account would have a means of adding to the balance,
password authentication, etc.
</p><p>
You would have a superuser account for your own watching as well as
changing any of the individual account settings.
</p><p>
Too bad I don't still teach my intro to computer design courses - this
would make a nice term project.
</p><p>
If you have a junker PC, this would be a simple bit of programming
(but quite wasteful of power even for an 8088 based PC).

</p><h3><a name="tvaquadag">What is Aquadag?</a></h3>

You may see the term 'Aquadag' referring the the black paint covering the
outside of most of the funnel section of the CRT.
<p>
(From: Nicholas Bodley (nbodley@tiac.net).)
</p><p>
Aquadag used to be a trademark of Acheson Colloids [Corp.?], I think
around Niagara Falls or Buffalo, NY. It was one of many "-dag" colloidal
graphites; they also made Oildag, Gredag (grease), and Alcoholdag, as I
recall. Unfortunately, it's probably sold in 55-gallon drums minimum. I
hope you can find smaller quantities. Are there any CRT rebuild shops
around the USA?  See the Thomas Catalog (ThomCat) in a library to find
Acheson.
</p><p>
I am pretty sure there's nothing magic about the graphite. If you can find
some reasonably-priced nickel-flake or copper-flake paint (be sure it's
conductive!), you might have an affordable (?) coating. How about plain
metal foil, maybe even ordinary aluminum foil? You surely don't need
current-carrying capacity; you would need a decent adhesive, though. How
to make sure you have continuity between pieces, I'm not so sure; shoot
for really tight crimps that deform the metal and are gas-tight. (This
might, however, be quite unnecessary.) 

</p><h3><a name="tvmonandtv">Combined computer monitor and TV</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"This is a 27" VGA monitor which should also be able to be used as an NTSC
 television monitor.  Can anybody comment on it?"
</blockquote>
<p>
IMO, I think the entire idea of a combined TV/computer monitor is silly
especially when the likely cost premium is taken into account.  Watching
the boob tube will tie up your entire PC.  The optimal size for TV and
computer use is not the same nor are the requirements in terms of scan
rate, resolution, brightness, and sharpness.  Thus, the design will be
inherently more expensive and include more compromises.

So, I will probably be proved wrong by record sales of these things but
my only justification for such a hybrid would be if there were absolutely
no space for both.

</p><h3><a name="tvitvsmps">Interesting TV Switch Mode Power Supply</a></h3>

The following was found in a Sony TV:
<p>
</p><pre>                         Q1 switching/reg
                            transistor

         +--+     (-)  |    | Reg. Drive |         C           |
          D1           |    +-----+------+         C choke     +---- gnd
                       |          |                C          _|_
                       |          |                | +135 cap --- C2
                       |          |                |  I---&gt;    |+
                       +----------+----------------+-----------+---&gt; + 135

</pre>
<p>
Although at first this appears to short out the line supply, when
drawn like this it turns out to be a valid switching regulator:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Q1 is driven by a pulse width modulated signal a the horizontal rate.
<p>
</p></li><li>Q1 turns on putting 150 V across choke.  Current ramps up in choke - more or
 less linear until saturation which should not occur.  This time increases
 with increasing load.
<p>
</p></li><li>Q1 turns off.  Since current in an inductor cannot change instantly, current
 continues to flow, now through D2, C2, and +135 load.  LCR (R of load,
 diode) time constant - charges capacitor and powers load.
</li></ul>
<p>
It would appear to fail and run away under the following circumstances:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Inductance is too low and choke cannot store enough energy even at high duty
 cycle to supply load.  Too high a duty cycle and core saturates at which
 point transistor blows up.
<p>
</p></li><li>Inductance is too high relative to switching frequency so that choke
 does not have time to discharge (its current) before next current pulse -
 DC current will just keep increasing until core saturates.  This could only
 really happen if the switching frequency were too high for some reason
 unless someone changed core material or something like t.
<p>
</p></li><li>Load is too great due to fault elsewhere.
</li></ol>
<p>
Unfortunately for reliability and troubleshooting, many modern power supply
designs have similar failings.
</p><p>
When attempting to diagnose problems with these types of circuits where the
natural outcome of a fault is for one or more expensive parts to fail
catastrophically, it is wise to either use a Variac to bring up the input
voltage slowly and carefully observe the behavior hopefully before too late
or put a load in series with the line such as a 100W light bulb to limit
the current (though this will change the behavior in various ways).

</p><h3><a name="tvhotsubsj">The horizontal output transistor substitution jig trick</a></h3>

(From: penguin@datastar.net).
<p>
Okay, here's a good trick you can use for almost all TV work. Mount a TO-3
transistor socket on a heatsink that has about as much surface area as the
skin of both fists balled up, actually the bigger the heatsink the better.
Then mount a horizontal output transistor in the socket.  Use an ECG238 or
equivalent.  Make sure you use a good mica insulator, as there will be over a
thousand volts on the collector.
</p><p>
Solder a 1.5 foot red wire (18 gauge or bigger) to the collector, an equal but
yellow wire to the base and an equal but green wire to the emitter (or use
your own color codes).  You may be able to salvage a ready made heatsink with
socket out of an old receiver or TV. Mine came out of some old Curtis Mathes
TV's.  Solder a damper diode with the cathode to the collector and the anode
to the emitter. Add a 200 ohm 1/4 watt resistor from base to emitter. Add
these parts to the socket not the transistor, so the transistor can easily be
changed if you ever need to.
</p><p>
Now you have a very useful test jig. If you are ever working on a TV that has
a blown HOT (horizontal output transistor) you can pull out the bad part and
connect this jig. Then you can run the set at low voltage.
</p><p>
If you have a set where the HOT is running too hot, this method often will
give you some running time, hopefully enough time to find out what the problem
is. Often the bad parts themselves will self destruct or heat up to where
identifying them is easy. Usually a bad flyback will crack and smoke proving
itself to be bad. Once your satisfied that the problem is cured, you can put
the original HOT in knowing it will be safe.
</p><p>
Usually when I power a TV in this way (using a Variac) I'll bypass the series
pass regulator with a jumper. This is easily done by finding the 180 to 330
ohm 15 to 20 watt regulator bypass resistor and putting a jumper across it.
With the regulator bypassed the power supply will go to 160 volts this is why
it is necessary to use a Variac and only run it at about 60 volts. It is
necessary when using this brute force approach, to make sure that all of the
low voltage supplies coming off the flyback are fused with fusible
resistors. Most models do fuse the LV supplies, but some don't. (One
particular RCA comes to mind.) &nbsp; Another good trick, if your out in the
field and don't have a varactor handy, is to simply pull the series pass
regulator (e.g. STR30130 etc.) and let all the power just come through the 20
w bypass resistor. If the flyback is okay the B+ to the flyback will come up
to about 60 to 90 volts, and in many cases you can even see a dim picture.&nbsp;
Anything less than 50-60 volts and the flyback is probably bad. Don't run it
this way for more than a minute or two as the the resistor will be dissipating
close to or more than its rated power under these circumstances. Of coarse you
obviously can't use this method with switching power supplies.
</p><p>
Here's a good trick for the Sony TVs that use the SG-613, even though this
device is a gate controlled SCR you can sub a regular HOT like the ECG238 on
your test jig. I used to blow out these buggers to the tune of about $20
dollars a pop til I figured out how to use the "HOT Heatsink Jig". Now with
the jig connected, the horizontal width may not open up all the way, but you
can run these old Sony's like this for about 5 minutes before the HOT jig
starts to get too hot. Usually if they run this long they're ok and then you
can put the SG-613 in knowing that you aren't going to see a bunch of $$$ go
up in smoke. I had a Sony that would run for weeks then blow the SG-613
finally put this one to rest when I changed out the horizontal output
transformer which was separate from the flyback on this oldie.
</p><p>
Always be cautious of the high voltage on the collector of the HOT JIG.

</p><h3><a name="tvkcotvsmpsr">Ken's comments on (TV) SMPS repair</a></h3>

(From Kenneth Aaron (kennetha@geocities.com).)
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>NEVER NEVER NEVER power on a SMPS without load, the newer ones especially
 in TVs (not so much VCRs) self destruct when not loaded.
<p>
</p></li><li>The light bulb test is great to see if your SMPS can handle the load of the
 horizontal circuits - when the set does not turn on - you get the initial
 power on then it goes off - best is to disconnect the collector of the
 horizontal output transistor and plug in a light bulb and see if it goes on.
<p>
</p></li><li>Chinese TVs have poor quality capacitors - the latest models mostly have the
 same SMPS so this applies for all.  There is a small electrolyte cap in the
 supply feedback about 22 to 47uF at 50V.  This dries up real fast and after
 2 years or so the voltage B+ goes up from 110 V to anything up to 300 V!
 (not joking here).  I got a TV where the end of the tube was blown off from
 a supply that reached 296 V instead of 105 V. that's over 75kV into the
 screen!
<p>
</p></li><li>The newer Philips and copycat Chinese models use the main supply to power
 the horizontal.  The flyback is driven by a transistor which has over 2500 V
 on it's collector.  The flyback is built differently as well.  These
 transistors are called 2DS... - do not use a replacement - I did use one
 with a higher voltage and it fried - this is because the ceramic capacitors
 around it along with it's different characteristics changed the 'on' time
 and it overheated after a few minutes.
<p>
</p></li><li>You can always use a BU208D instead of a BU208A, BU508D instead of BU508A,
 etc, the extra diode will do no harm.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvirdetc">IR detector circuit</a></h3>

This IR Detector may be used for testing of IR remote controls, CD player
laserdiodes, and other low level near IR emitters.
<p>
Component values are not critical. Purchase photodiode sensitive to near
IR - 750-900 um or salvage from optocoupler or photosensor.  Dead computer
mice, not the furry kind, usually contain IR sensitive photodiodes. For
convenience, use a 9V battery for power.  Even a weak one will work fine.
Construct so that LED does not illuminate the photodiode!

The detected signal may be monitored at the collector of the transistor (Q1)
with an oscilloscope.

<h2>International Color Television Standards</h2>
<h3><a name="tvbdoicts">Brief description of international color TV standards</a></h3>

(The following is from Bob Myers: (myers@fc.hp.com).)
<p>
Well, the joke was that SECAM stands for System Essentially Contrary to
the American Method....:-)
</p><p>
The basic, oversimplified description of the three common encoding methods
is as follows:
</p><p>
NTSC: Used in North America, Japan, and a few other areas.  Luminance ("black
and white" information) is sent just as it was before color, and color
information is provided in two "color difference" signals (actually, derived
along with the luminance (Y) signal) via matrix multiplication) which
are carried on a "color subcarrier".  The chroma (color) signals are severely
band-limited compared to the luminance signal, which is one reason you can
never fully recover proper RGB from an NTSC-encoded signal.  The color 
information itself is encoded such that the PHASE of the chroma signals,
relative to the reference signal, is important in recovering the color.
As used in the U.S., the broadcast standard provides a line rate of approx.
15,734.26 Hz, and a field rate of 59.94+ Hz*
</p><p>
PAL: Very similar to NTSC, with the exception that the phase of the color
subcarrier is reversed on alternate lines; this tends to cancel some of
the more common color errors seen in the NTSC system.  (The color signals
of PAL are also simple color-difference signals, rather than using the more
involved RGB -&gt; YIQ matrix of NTSC).  In the most common European PAL 
broadcast systems, a line rate of 15,625 Hz and a field rate of 50.00 Hs
are used*.
</p><p>
SECAM: This system is very different from both NTSC and PAL.  Luminance and
color-difference signals are still used, but the color difference signals
are sent separately, on successive lines.  This requires at least a one-line
memory or delay line be provided in the receiver for proper color decoding.
The broadcast SECAM systems usually use similar line/field rates as for
the PAL broadcast standards noted above*.
</p><p>
Note: In all three cases, the terms "NTSC", "PAL", and "SECAM" technically
refer only to the COLOR-ENCODING systems described above; they do not
specifically imply a set of timing standards or frequencies.  The one
possible exception to this is the use of the term "NTSC", since the
U.S. National Television Standards Committee ALSO came up with various
timing standards for U.S. television.  But in all cases, the color
encoding method is not *strongly* tied to a specific line/field timing.
For example, there is at least one broadcast system (Brazil's) which uses
NTSC encoding, but at the line/field rates more commonly seen in the
European systems.

</p><h3><a name="tvsqaaats">Some questions and answers about TV standards</a></h3>

(Responses from: Steve McKinty: (smckinty@france.sun.com))
<p>
<b>1. What are the most common TV standards in the world?</b>
</p><p>
NTSC:	National Television Standards Committee
PAL:	Phase Alternate Line
SECAM:	SEquential Couleur Avec Memoire (Sequential colour with memory)
</p><p>
There are other differences though. Strictly they are just different
colour systems, but most countries which use PAL have 625 lines in
a picture and send 25 full pictures/second, most NTSC countries have
525 lines and send 30 full pictures/second (mostly for historical
rather than technical reasons). That complicates things.
</p><p>
<b>2. Who devised them, and when? and why? Are they as old as television?</b>
</p><p>
The first serious TV experimenting was done in several countries around
the period 1900-1930, mostly black &amp; white. The BBC started a regular
service in 1936, other countries followed soon after, but since the
technology was developing very rapidly there were always improvements
being made. The BBC started with 405 lines, the US started a service
a couple of years later with 525, by the time other European countries
started the technology allowed 625 lines. France even tried 819 lines.
</p><p>
All those system were black &amp; white, but people wanted to have
colour. During the 1940's much of Europe was at war, and technological
development for entertainment slowed down, but in the US they
were able to continue and devised a colour system which was
compatible with the existing black &amp; white one.
</p><p>
By compatible I mean that a black &amp; white TV got a black &amp; white
picture, a colo(u)r one got a colour picture. No need to make people
throw away their B&amp;W TVs. This system was endorsed by the American
National Television Standards Committee, and was named after it =&gt; NTSC.
</p><p>
After the war other countries started to look at colour. NTSC was a
very clever system, but it had some flaws. Engineers in various
countries tried to improve on it, and Telefunken in Germany came up
with a simple modification which improved colour stability. It
was named PAL because they reversed the Phase of the colour signal on
Alternate Lines.
</p><p>
At the same time Henri de France, in France, fixed the same flaw in
a different way. His design (SECAM) needed a memory inside the set
which made it more expensive. PAL gave as good a result, so most
countries opted for that. France stayed with SECAM, possibly because
in the De Gaulle era of the 50's memories of German occupation were
still fresh, and dropping a French system in favour of a German one
would have been unpopular. Rumour has it that the French government
subsidized Thomson to make memory affordable.
</p><p>
Since Britain went PAL, France went SECAM, and the US went NTSC, any
colonies or dependencies of those countries tended to get the same
system. India/Pakistan got PAL, Algeria got SECAM, and since the
US helped rebuild Japan after WW2 it got NTSC, etc.
</p><p>
<b>3. What's the difference?</b>
</p><p>
To squeeze a colour signal into the same space as a black &amp; white one,
and stay compatible, the NTSC designers separated the colour and
brightness information. The human eye is less sensitive to colour, so
they were able to reduce the bandwidth of that signal (make it take
up less space in each channel), 'hiding' it at the high-frequency
end of the video. That meant they didn't need to make the channels
bigger, and incompatible.
</p><p>
To do that, they used the fact that you can represent most colours
with a combination of Red, Green and Blue. If you film a scene
with three cameras, one for each colour, then add all the
outputs together you get a black &amp; white image. This signal
is called luminance, usually represented by 'Y'. Mathematically
Y = R + G + B.  (Actually, not all the contributions are equal).
</p><p>
They then transmitted the Y signal just as for a black &amp; white TV,
and also transmitted the R and B in the extra colour signal. B&amp;W TV's
only saw Y, and colour TV's got Y, R and B. Since Y = R + B + G, G can
be obtained as Y - (R+B), so they didn't need to transmit all three.
</p><p>
To get both R and B into one signal, they use a combination of
Phase and Amplitude modulation (think of it as AM and FM at the same
time). Its called quadrature modulation, and works very well, but is
susceptible to phase changes as it passes along cables, etc. If the
signal gets +10 degrees phase change the colour will visibly change,
which is why NTSC TV's have a tint control.
</p><p>
PAL overcomes that by sending R and +B on one line, then R and -B on
the next. That way a +10 phase shift on one line becomes -10 on the next,
and small differences will cancel out. PAL TV's don't need tint controls.
(Some old PAL sets may have a one, however).
</p><p>
SECAM doesn't send both R &amp; B together, it sends R on one line, B on
the next. No fancy modulation, so no phase problems, but you need a
'memory' in the set to save up the signal from the previous line,
since both R &amp; B are required together for processing.
</p><p>
<b>4. Why do you need different TVs?</b>
</p><p>
Mostly because of the different numbers of lines. Its quite easy to
make one colour decoder which can cope with all the systems, but
making a TV which can do 625 and 525 lines, 25 and 30 pictures/second,
gets expensive. Consumers shop on price, no-one will buy a SECAM
TV in the USA even if it only costs $20 more, since there aren't
any SECAM channels.
</p><p>
<b>5. Why do you need different VCRs? Why can't one VCR record the
 same "output"?</b>
</p><p>
Some can, but like TVs it costs more to make them adjust. The motor
speed varies with the number of pictures transmitted per second, for
example.   (This is covered in more detail in the document:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/vcrfaq.htm">Notes on the Troubleshooting and Repair of Video
Cassette Recorders</a>.)
</p><p>
<b>6. Why did different systems evolve? Is one cheaper? Is one better?</b>
</p><p>
When originally developed, expense was considered based on contemporary
technology.  As noted, politics may have been equally important.
</p><p>
As to which has better quality, its all rather subjective. The
625-line system adopted in Europe has better vertical resolution
than the 525-line US system, but some people find the 50Hz field rate
still produces some flicker. NTSC/PAL/SECAM are all equally capable
of excellent colour reproduction, but under poor signal conditions
NTSC can degrade more quickly.
</p><p>
<b>7. Are there other systems besides the ones I've mentioned? Why?</b>
</p><p>
Some others, like MAC where the colour and luminance are completely
separated. That gets rid of interference (ever see the strange
colours which appear on very fine check patterns?) but is more
expensive and really only possible due to modern electronics.
</p><p>
<b>8. Are there going to be more or less systems in the future?</b>
</p><p>
That is THE question! There are certainly going to be different
systems, more lines, better sound, etc.
</p><p>
<b>9. Is there any way to convert a PAL tape to NTSC or vice versa?</b>
</p><p>
Yes. If the PAL tape has 625 line pictures and the NTSC one has 525 line
then you normally need a computer which can read in one format and
re-adjust things. Not cheap, but becoming cheaper, several companies
offer that sort of service.  Some PAL VCRs can do a half-conversion,
enough to fool most PAL TVs into thinking its got a PAL signal.
</p><p>
<b>10. Do they teach this stuff in electrical engineering courses?</b>
</p><p>
Sometimes.  Some of it, depends a lot on the course and school.

               No tint control. A color control.
               Partial socialism. The state knows exactly what color you

       NTSC:
               Used in USA and Canada, Japan etc.
               A tint control, A color control.
               Uncontrolled socialism. The state lets you chose what color you
               see and how strong it can be. They then tax you regardless.
</pre>
<p>
Just another way of looking at it....

</p><h3><a name="tvvpastps">Variations on a 'standard' - the PAL system</a></h3>

In the U.S., when PAL is mentioned, it is usually assumed to be 625 line/50 Hz
as used in the UK and man other places.  However, there are several variations
on the PAL system.
<p>
(The following from: Ed Ellers <edellers@delphi.com)) <p="">
I can think of five major groups right off:
</edellers@delphi.com))></p><p>
PAL B/G/H - 625-line 50 Hz systems used in most European countries and many
countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
</p><p>
PAL I - Again 625 lines at 50 Hz, but with a different sound carrier
frequency.  Used in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong,
South Africa and a few other places I've forgotten.
</p><p>
PAL D/K - Yet another 625-line system with a different sound carrier.  Used in
some former Warsaw Pact countries as well as mainland China; this may become
more popular as PAL/SECAM receivers become common in the CIS republics and
other former Soviet bloc countries, since those countries now use SECAM D/K.
</p><p>
PAL M - This one's 525 lines at 59.94 Hz; it's just like NTSC except for
PAL-type color encoding.  It's used mainly in Brazil.
</p><p>
PAL N - A real oddity, with 625-line 50 Hz video but a *lower* sound carrier
and a lower color subcarrier than the B/G/H, I and D/K varieties.  It's used
in Argentina and a few other places.

</p><h3><a name="tvwapswathc">What about PAL sets WITH a tint/hue control?</a></h3>

Here is one for the record books - a Sony PAL TV that really wants to be NTSC!
<p>
(From: Tony Duell (ard@p850ug1.demon.co.uk).)
</p><p>
Although this very old Sony set (KV-1300) receives PAL signals, it's much
closer to an NTSC set inside. In fact it's one of the strangest PAL decoders
that I have ever seen. As you know, in the PAL system, the phase of one of the
colour signals is inverted on each line, and in the receiver there's a
bistable which switches at half the line rate to re-invert the colour signal
on alternate lines. Well, to avoid a patent, the Sony set only uses (say) the
in-phase colour signal that's received on alternate lines.  For the lines in
between it uses the previous line's colour signal (ignoring the incoming
inverted one), which has been stored in a delay line. 
</p><p>
This approach avoids the main patent on the PAL system. It also means that
this  set doesn't automatically correct for phase errors in the colour
signals - it's almost an NTSC decoder.  Hence the hue control (which is also
on my kV1320UB schematic).  It's just about the only set like that.

<h3><a name="tvnocbfreq">Notes on cable and broadcast frequencies</a></h3>

(The following is from: (kruskal@watson.ibm.com (Vincent Kruskal).)
<p>
RF band: To get the band, subtract 1.25 from picture carrier (low end)
and add 4.75 (high end).
</p><p>
Color subcarrier: Add 3.58... to picture carrier.
</p><p>
Sound carrier: Add 4.5 to picture carrier.
</p><p>
HRC: Harmonically Related Carrier.  Makes both second- and third-order
beats invisible by making them fall directly on the picture carrier of
other channels.  That is, multiplying the picture carrier by two or
three will yield exactly another picture carrier.
</p><p>
IRC: Incrementally Related Carrier, add 1.25 to HRC frequency.  A
General Instruments (Jerrold) catalog said that IRC makes third-order
(more important than second-order) beats invisible by making them fall
directly on the picture carrier of other channels.  But it is not true
that multiplying an IRC picture carrier by two or three yields another
IRC picture carrier.  This contradiction has not been resolved.  The
reason third-order harmonics are more important is that oscillators and
amplifiers tend to generate odd-order harmonics far more than even-order
ones.
</p><p>
Broadcast frequency: Add 1.25 to HRC frequency except for channels 5 and
6.  For them, subtract 0.75.  But these are just nominal frequencies.
The FCC actually has three channel designations for each number as in 5,
5- and 5+.  The minus channels are 10 kHz below the nominal value and
the plus channels are 10 kHz above.  For example:

</p><h3><a name="tvhdtvfrgc">How did the (vertical) frame rate get chosen</a></h3>

Some people think that TVs are synchronized to the local power line since the
vertical scan rate is around 60 Hz (or 50 Hz).  This is not correct.
<p>
No TV (at least once the broadcast standards were defined - some experimental
schemes did) ever used the power line for synchronization.  However, older TVs
had line frequency power transformers (no SMPSs) whose stray magnetic fields
could affect the CRT deflection slightly.  So it made sense (well, this is one
justification at least) to make the vertical scan rate (field rate) equal to
the power line frequency.  Otherwise, there would be a jiggle or wiggle in the
picture due to the stray magnetic field affecting the deflection of the beam
inside the CRT.  Since it was thought at the time (and for other reasons as
well like cost) that 60 Hz was adequate to produce an acceptable amount of
flicker, this all fit together nicely.
</p><p>
In the good old days before color TV, the frame/field rate was exactly 30/60
Hz (or 25/50) Hz. With color, it had to be changed slightly (see the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvwinsswf">Why is the NTSC color subcarrier such a weird frequency?</a>)
but since TVs no longer use line power transformers, there would not even be a slow
position shift (period of several seconds) due to this so it didn't matter.

</p><h3><a name="tvwinsswf">Why is the NTSC color subcarrier such a weird frequency?</a></h3>

(The following is from Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com).)
<p>
Actually, if we wanted to define the rates to the Nth degree, the important
starting point is the field rate.  The NTSC color frame rate was defined as
(60 * 1000/1001) Hz, which is a bit more than 59.94 Hz.  From this rate, all
the others in the system are defined.  The line rate is 262.5 times this, and
the color subcarrier is defined as 455/2 times the line rate.  This is often
given as simply 3.579545 MHz, but the the color subcarrier was actually
derived from the line/field rates rather than the other way around.
</p><p>
The whole thing was done so as to avoid (or at least minimize) interaction
between the luminance, chrominance, and audio subcomponents in the standard
color signal.  This could have been achieved by moving either the audio
subcarrier or adjusting the line and frame rates as described above.
Unfortunately, the latter route was chosen, leaving us with this very
strange looking set of rates.
</p><p>
The precise color burst frequency winds up being 3.579545.4545... under
this definition, but giving it to the nearest Hz is within the tolerances
of the system.

</p><h3><a name="tvwimadohf">What is the maximal allowed deviation of the horizontal frequency?</a></h3>

(The following is from: Peter Bennett VE7CEI (bennett@triumf.ca))
<p>
In Canada and the US (525 line, 60 HZ, NTSC), the horizontal frequency is
15,734.264 Hz.  The colour subcarrier is 455/2 times the horizontal
frequency which should come to 3.579545 MHz. I believe the tolerance on
the subcarrier frequency is +/- 10 Hz.

</p><h3><a name="tvinfcotvs">Informal comparison of TV standards</a></h3>

Q: I heard that TV in certain part of Europe has more quality in
Europe then here in North America.  I'd like to know the differences between
the two systems.  Is that why we cant use video tapes from there?
<p>
(Responses from: Mark Zenier (mzenier@netcom.com or mzenier@eskimo.com))
</p><p>
The first difference is that a lot of the world runs on 50 Hz power
as opposed to North America's 60 Hz power.  In the olden days, before
active power supply regulators got cheap, it was decided that the
vertical scan rate match the power supply frequency, so that ripple
in the power supply wouldn't produce obnoxious visual effects.
</p><p>
So the PAL/SECAM signals have 50 vertical scans per second.
</p><p>
I don't know the exact reasoning, but the horizontal scan rate is
close to the same.   15750 (now 15734) for 60 Hz, and 15625 for 50 Hz
systems.  My guess is the tradeoff between cost (50 years or so ago) 
and audibility for a large portion of the population.
</p><p>
So 50 Hz systems have more lines - 625 vs. 525 lines for
60 Hz systems.
</p><p>
The second difference is that European TV channels are wider.  7 or 8 MHz
compared to the North American 6 MHz.  Video bandwidth is limited to 
4.2 MHz in a 6 MHz channel, but can be as much as 6 MHz in some of the
50 Hz systems.  (Note: Systems is plural.  There are many different
European systems with incompatible color and sound transmission methods.)
</p><p>
As for the quality, if you move a little farther away, so that a pixel 
on each system subtends the same angle, NTSC doesn't have a poorer 
picture, just a smaller one.

</p><h3><a name="tvpalplus">PAL-plus</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"I wonder if you could tell me about PAL-Plus.  The last time I
 was in Germany was in '84 so I've been out of touch with them."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Jeroen H. Stessen (Jeroen.Stessen@philips.com).)
</p><p>
Oh boy, here goes another long story:
</p><p>
PAL-plus is an attempt to extend the life-cycle of terrestrial PAL
transmissions by including compatible wide-screen (16:9) transmissions. It
is an advanced variant of the letterbox format, this means that when you
receive a PAL-plus widescreen program on an older 4:3 receiver you will see
black bars top and bottom.  It was originally developed in Germany (university
of Dortmund in cooperation with German terrestrial broadcasters and some
setmakers). Later a large consortium of European and Japanese setmakers took
over and finished the job. Strangely, the German broadcasters seem to use
PAL-plus only very rarely.
</p><p>
The PAL-plus standard comprises three extensions to the PAL-standard:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Vertical helper. In order to compensate for the fact that 1/4 of the video
 lines are not used, which would deteriorate vertical resolution for the
 widescreen viewer, the missing vertical information has been coded into
 the black lines in a manner as to be nearly invisible on a 4:3 receiver
 (you see some dark blue).  The 16:9 PAL-plus receiver combines 432 visible
 lines plus 144 helper lines into 576 new visible lines.
<p>
</p></li><li>Colour-plus. The PAL colour carrier is modulated in a slightly different
 way (making use of correlation between 2 fields) in order to give a cleaner
 Y/C separation in the PAL-plus receiver.
<p>
</p></li><li>Signaling bits from which the receiver can conclude whether the
 transmission is 4:3/16:9/PAL-plus and adapt the display format accordingly.
 The bandwidth of these bits is low enough to survive recording on a VHS
 recorder.
</li></ol>
<p>
In order to enable a poor-man's PAL-plus receiver, the standard permits using
the mark "PAL-plus" if at least the vertical helper reconstruction is included.
Colour-plus is optional, so you will find sets on the market with only half of
the PAL-plus extension.
</p><p>
PAL-plus may also be combined with teletext, ghost cancellation reference,
digital Nicam stereo, VPS, PDC and what-you-have more.  Theoretically it can
be broadcast over a satellite channel too, but it was not designed for that
and some aspects of a satellite channel do indeed give interesting technical
problems.
</p><p>
There are also sets marketed as "PAL-plus compatible". These are mostly
widescreen sets without any PAL-plus processing at all, but they allow
switching of the display format between 4:3 and 16:9. They may well do that
automatically, based on the signaling bits. 
</p><p>
There are 2 methods for displaying a 4:3 letterboxed signal on a 16:9 display,
without using the PAL-plus helper lines:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Increase of the vertical deflection amplitude to display only the centre
 432 lines.
<p>
</p></li><li>Vertical interpolation without using the helper, to convert 432 lines into
 576 lines and display on a 576 lines display.
</li></ol>
<p>
Both modes may be called "movie expand".  Only when you really convert to
full-resolution widescreen will it be called "widescreen".
</p><p>
And there are 4 methods for displaying a regular 4:3 signal on a 16:9 display
(regular PAL, has nothing to do with PAL-plus):
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Decrease of the horizontal deflection amplitude, this gives black bars left
 and right.
<p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal interpolation, to convert N pixels to 3/4*N pixels.  Both modes
 may be called "4:3" or "normal".
<p>
</p></li><li>Non-linear horizontal deflection waveform, called "Panorama mode" by JVC,
 works by increasing the S-capacitor value.
<p>
</p></li><li>Non-linear horizontal interpolation, called "Superwide" by Philips, works
 with an advanced sample-rate converter.
</li></ol>
<p>
With both modes, the left and right edges of the picture will be stretched to
fill the left and right bars, but the aspect ratio of the centre part of the
picture will hardly be affected.
</p><p>
Interesting, huh?

</p><h3><a name="tvntsconpal">More information about watching NTSC video on PAL systems</a></h3>

(From: Aaron Smart (spectrum_kid@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Most VCRs of remote quality sold in the British Isles (UK &amp; Ireland) and
probably other PAL regions (and definitely in the Middle East) in the past
few years say something along the lines of "NTSC playback on PAL TV". It's
usually automatic (it often takes the VCR about a second to adjust to NTSC
speed), but some older VCRs have a switch.  They don't usually go into much
detail about how it's done in the manuals, but I'm pretty sure they usually
just convert the signal to NTSC 4.43.  Many decent TVs made in the last
decade or so can handle this well enough, but some (most noted are Philips
sets) will only display it in a kind of 'meshed' black and white.  However, use
of an RGB connection (e.g. SCART) removes this problem.
</p><p>
All DVD players sold in PAL regions (I think) are equipped to play NTSC
video (too bad that most of them only play Region 2 discs, which means the
only NTSC discs they can play are Japanese or region-free titles). I don't
know exactly how every player works of course, but with ones I have used,
they either just play NTSC discs in NTSC 4.43 or have the option to do that
or play them in 'PAL' which I assume is PAL 4.43 at 60Hz which seems to be
the same, except it won't turn out in blank and white with a composite
connection as it does on some sets.
</p><p>
Also, certain newer videogame consoles (Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo
Gamecube mostly) have many games that are allowed to be played in either 60
or 50Hz modes (since most games originate from NTSC regions, and 50Hz
versions are usually slowed down and contain sometimes MASSIVE 'letterbox'
borders). I don't know about other consoles, but the Dreamcast displayed
the 60Hz video modes in PAL.
</p><p>
Panasonic TV manuals call this system "PAL 60/525", and I've heard it
called "PAL 60" before, so it must be standardised to some extent.
</p><p>
I've tried a few PAL TVs with displaying 60Hz (PAL or NTSC), and here's
some vague results of what happened:
(O = yes, X = No.  'M' under NTSC only means black and white with composite
or RF connection - not tested with RGB. Sorry I don't know the model numbers
for all the tested sets.  All models are Irish models unless stated)

</pre>
<p>
I've noticed that on a lot of sets that 60Hz pictures go off the screen a
bit (vertically), and the OSD is stretched with it.
</p><p>
As for multi-region TV sets, most sets sold in the British Isles only
receive PAL I RF transmissions, but I've seen some cheaper TVs sold in
Ireland with PAL G as well.  However, I have seen a widescreen Philips set
(circa 2000, 32"?) that actually had a country selection menu - and it was
definitely changing to the different PAL systems and to SECAM when I put it
on France.  I personally haven't seen other TVs like this, but there
probably are others.
</p><p>
In the Middle East, though, it's a totally different story.  In Saudi Arabia,
anyway, all TV sets and VCRs had at least PAL (dunno which one) and MESECAM
support.  Most VHS VCRs had NTSC 4.43 playback, you could get multi-region
TVs which had support for PAL, SECAM, NTSC 4.43 and NTSC 3.58.  I had a
multi-region Daewoo TV which had 4 LEDs below the screen to tell you which
system you were watching - how nice!

<h2>Service Information</h2>
<h3><a name="tvadvtrb">Advanced TV troubleshooting</a></h3>

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document,
you still have some options other than surrendering your TV to the local
service center or the dumpster.
<p>
Also see the related document: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tshoot.htm">Troubleshooting and
Repair of Consumer Electronic Equipment</a>.
</p><p>
Manufacturer's service literature:  Service manuals are available
for a great deal of consumer electronics.  Once you have exhausted the
obvious possibilities, the cost may be well worth it.  Depending on the
type of equipment, these can range in price from $10-50 or more.  Some
are more useful than others.  However, not all include the schematics so
if you are hoping to repair an electronic problem try to check before buying.
</p><p>
Inside cover of the equipment:  TVs often have some kind of circuit
diagram pasted inside the back cover.  In the old days, this was
a complete schematic.  Now, if one exists at all, it just shows part
numbers and location for key components - still very useful.  Some
TVs - as late as 10 years ago, maybe even now - included a complete
schematic with the product information and owner's manual.  I have a
1984 Mitsubishi which has this.  It is, however, the exception rather
than the rule anymore.
</p><p>
Sams' Photofacts (http://www.samswebsite.com/):  These have been published
for over 45 years (I don't know for how long but I have Sams' for a 1949
portable (3 inch) Pilot TV - about as portable as an office typewriter (if
you remember what one of those was like) and are generally the best most
consistent source of service info for TVs (nearly every model that has ever
been sold), radios, some VCRs and other consumer electronics.  For TV
servicing, they are indispensable.
</p><p>
There are some Computerfacts but the number of these is very limited.  The
VCRfacts are also somewhat limited and the newer ones tend to have strictly
(obvious) mechanical information.
</p><p>
Even if they don't list your model, they may have a folder for one using the
same chassis so search by chassis number as well.  Even if this doesn't help,
there still may be a folder for models that are similar enough to be of value
(though you really have to be in the library to be able to determine this by
looking at the circuit diagrams or photos) so check out folders for other
model numbers that are close to the one you really want.
</p><p>
You can search this site to determine if they have a folder for your model.
Service info (EFacts) for most models manufactured after 1992 is available
in electronic form (currently) about $11.  These are similar to the print
PhotoFacts but may be ordered on-line and will arrive via email within 1
business day.  The hard copy versions are also available from major
electronics distributors but may be more expensive than the EFacts.
However, I don't know how quickly the Photofact is created after a new model
is introduced.  So, if your set is just out of warranty, it's possible that
none is available.
</p><p>
Sams' Photofacts are also often available (for photocopy costs) from your
local large public library which may subscribe to the complete series.
</p><p>
One advantage of the Sams' info is that it is compiled in a very consistent
format so that once you are familiar with one model TV, it is easy to
transfer that knowledge to any other.  They provide waveforms at key
locations and DC voltage measurements almost everywhere.  Additional info
such as IC pin to ground and coil resistances are often provided as well.
The manufacturer's service manuals are generally not nearly as complete.
</p><p>
Note that I have no connection with Sams Technical Publishing (formerly
Howard Sams).
</p><p>
Elsewhere around the world, libraries may also have Sams' or other service
information:
</p><p>
(From: Chris Laudan (chris.laudan@zetnet.co.uk).)
</p><p>
This is true here in UK too, though not Sams photofacts, just schematics
issued by manufacturers. Go to the reference library and ask for Video and TV
service manuals, most main libraries carry a good selection.
</p><p>
(From: Michael Covington (mcovingt@ai.uga.edu).)
</p><p>
Concerning Sams' Photofacts, here is a bit of history that seems to be very
little known:
</p><p>
The name "Sams" is not an acronym, nor is it "Sam." It's the last name of
Howard W. Sams, who founded the Howard Sams publishing company (now Sams
Technical Publishing).  Accordingly, they are "Sams' Photofacts" rather than
any of various other spellings that we often see on the net.  
</p><p>
And they're a great product.  Apparently "Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Indianapolis,
Indiana" is a sufficient address to reach them.  So is 1-800-GAT-SAMS.

</p><h3><a name="tvsrvman">Service manuals for really old TVs</a></h3>

Try your large public library for Sams' photofacts.  I found a 3" TV of 
from around 1948 at a yard sale.  There was no problem finding a complete
set of Sams' service information including full schematics, parts list (of
course, finding suitable parts like tubes in the 1990s may be a bit more
difficult than when this set was new!), troubleshooting procedures, etc.
Someday, I may even get around to fixing it.  All the paper capacitors are
leaky (for starters).
<p>
BTW, the case for this 3" TV is about 18" x 10" x 15" and it includes
a handy option: a 6 inch semispherical water filled magnifier.  The CRT is
an oscilloscope tube.  Not your modern portable!

</p><h3><a name="tvhtlsiwa">How to locate service info when all the little stickers have fallen off</a></h3>

On newer TVs, the chassis number may be printed on the mainboard.
<p>
(From: "Clifton T. Sharp, Jr." <clifto@megsinet.net>
</clifto@megsinet.net></p><p>
Somewhere on the chassis there may be an inked chassis number; an example
for one color set was TS-914. A chassis number will at least get you some
service information, and should be all you need unless you plan to try to
get cabinet parts for it (chortle guffaw titter). Number should be findable
on the back of the chassis (i.e. where the pots are mounted through the
chassis).

<h3><a name="tvwebres">Web resources</a></h3>

Many manufacturers are now providing extensive information via the
World Wide Web.  The answer to you question may be a mouse click
away.  Perform a net search or just try to guess the manufacturer's
home page address.  The most obvious is often correct.  It will usually
be of the form "http://www.xxx.com" where xxx is the manufacturers' name,
abbreviation, or acronym.  For example, Hewlett Packard is hp, Sun
Microsystems is sun, Motorola is, you guessed it,  motorola.  Electronic
parts manufacturers often have detailed datasheets for their product
offerings.  For example:

<h3><a name="tvpartsinfo">Parts information</a></h3>

I have found one of the most useful single sources for general
information on semiconductors to be the ECG Semiconductors Master
Replacement Guide, about $6 from your local Philips distributor.
STK, NTE, and others have similar manuals.  The ECG manual will
enable you to look up U.S., foreign, and manufacturer 'house' numbers
and identify device type, pinout, and other information.  Note that
I am not necessarily recommending using ECG (or other generic) replacements
if the original replacements are (1) readily available and (2) reasonably
priced.  However, the cross reference can save countless hours searching
through databooks or contacting the manufacturers.  Even if you have
a wall of databooks, this source is invaluable.  A couple of caveats:
(1) ECG crosses have been known to be incorrect - the specifications
of the ECG replacement part were inferior to the original. (2) Don't
assume that the specifications provided for the ECG part are identical
to the original - they may be better in some ways.  Thus, using the ECG
to determine the specifications of the parts in your junk bin can be risky.

<h3><a name="tvfccid">FCC ID Numbers of TVs</a></h3>

Only a few manufacturers actually produce the vast majority of TVs.  For
example, Radio Shack, Magnavox, and Emerson do not make their own TVs (I
can tell you are not really surprised!).
<p>
How do you determine the actual manufacturer?  For most types of consumer
electronic equipment, there is something called an 'FCC ID' or 'FCC number'.
Any type of equipment that may produce RF interference or be affected by
this is required to be registered with the FCC.  This number can be used
to identify the actual manufacturer of the equipment.

<h3><a name="tvinterch">Interchangeability of components</a></h3>

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or
if I have a monitor, TV, or other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I
substitute a part that is not a precise match?  Sometimes, this is simply
desired to confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk of ordering an expensive
replacement and/or having to wait until it arrives.
<p>
For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
Typical parts of this type include flameproof resistors, some types of
capacitors, and specific parts dealing with CRT high voltage regulation.
However, during testing, it is usually acceptable to substitute electrically
equivalent parts on a temporary basis.  For example, an ordinary 1 ohm
resistor can be substituted for an open 1 ohm flameproof resistor to determine
if there are other problems in the horizontal deflection circuits before
placing an order - as long as you don't get lazy and neglect to install the
proper type before buttoning up the monitor or TV.
</p><p>
For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors.  Some deflection circuits are
so carefully matched to a specific horizontal output transistor that no
substitute will be reliable.
</p><p>
Here are some guidelines:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating.
 I have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
 long fuse as a substitute.
<p>
</p></li><li>Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
 LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
 safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits
 and specifications should be fine.  It is best to use the same type - metal
 film resistor, for example.  But for testing, even this is not a hard
 and fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.
<p>
</p></li><li>Rectifiers - many are of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
 types.  Replacements should have at equal or better  PRV, Imax, and Tr
 specifications.
<p>
</p></li><li>Posistors - many of these are similar.  Unfortunately, the markings on
 the devices are generally pretty useless in determining their ratings.
 Note, however, that the prices for replacement posistors may be quite
 reasonable from the original manufacturer so it may not make sense to
 take the risk of using an unknown part.
<p>
 (From: Stefan Huebner (Stefan.Huebner@rookie.antar.com).)
</p><p>
 In most cases you can use a standard 3-terminal-device, the resistance of
 the temperature dependent resistors in it are nearly identical. Here is a
 list of possible replacement devices:
</p><p>
 380000-01, 24340521, 2199-603-1201, 163-024A, 163-035A, CO2200-N66, C8ROH,
 QX265P05503, 32112026, 4822-A1-11240148, 02199-003-120, 15-08-001A,
 5391560067, F400001.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Transistors and thyristors (except HOTs and SMPS choppers) - substitutes
 will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
 of the original.  For testing, it is usually OK to use types that do not
 quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
 current specifications are not exceeded.  However, performance may not
 be quite as good.  For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.
<p>
 Also see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrepptwt">Replacement power transistors
 while testing</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Horizontal output (or SMPS) transistors - exact replacement is generally
 best but except for very high performance monitors, generic HOTs that
 have specifications that are at least as good will work in many cases.
 Make sure the replacement transistor has an internal damper diode if
 the original had one.  For testing with a series light bulb, even a
 transistor that doesn't quite meet specifications should work well
 enough (and not blow up) to enable you to determine what else may be
 faulty.  The most critical parameters are Vceo/Vcbo, IC, and Hfe which
 should all be at least equal to the original transistor.  I have often
 used by favorite BU208D as a temporary substitute for other HOTs and SMPS
 (chopper) transistors.  Make sure you use a heatsink and thermal grease
 in any case - even if you have to hang the assembly by a cable tie to
 make it fit.
<p>
 For that matter, you can usually substitute a similar HOT with the D
 suffix instead of the A (or no) suffix.  These have a built-in damper
 diode and two in parallel (the external one) will not hurt (or remove it).
 Naturally, the reverse is not true since a damper diode IS essential and
 the HOT will probably not last beyond the click of the power relay without
 one!
</p><p>
 On SVGA monitors, there will likely be additional circuitry between the
 HOT and the damper so this trick doesn't work for them.
</p><p>
 However, using a HOT with much better specs may actually result in early
 failure due to excessive heating from insufficient and/or suboptimal base
 drive.  See the document: "TV and Monitor Deflections Systems" for more
 info.
</p><p>
 For more information, see the document:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/deflfaq.htm">TV and Monitor Deflection Systems</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Deflection yokes - in the old days, particularly for B/W TVs, all of these
 were quite similar.  It was common to just swap with one that fit
 physically and at most need to adjust or change a width coil.  With color
 TVs and high performance multiscan monitors, this is no longer the case.
 Sometimes it will work but other times the power supply won't even be able
 to come up as a result of the impedance mismatch due to different coils
 and pole piece configurations.  In addition, there may be other geometry
 correction coils associated with the yoke that could differ substantially.
<p>
 However, if you are really determined, see the section:
 <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsoyoke">Swapping of deflection yokes</a>.
</p><p>
 Also see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvrepptwt">Replacement power transistors
 while testing</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Standby power transformer - this most likely only has a single secondary so
 locating a standard UL approved (for safety reasons) power transformer with
 the same output voltage should not be difficult.
<p>
 Check the service manual or the Sams' Photofact for the set to determine
 the required output voltage and if a centertap is needed.  Current should
 be quite low.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>CRTs - aside from the issues of physical size and mounting, many factors
 need to be considered.  These include deflection angle, neck diameter,
 base pinout, focus and screen voltage requirements, purity and convergence
 magnets, etc.  Color CRT replacement is rarely worth the effort in any
 case but trying to substitute a different CRT is asking for frustration.
 For monochrome CRTs, there is less variation and this may be worth a try. 
<p>
</p></li><li>The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
 your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: flyback (LOPT)
 and SMPS transformers, interstage coils or transformers, microcontrollers,
 and other custom programmed chips.
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="tvhottp">Horizontal output transistor pinouts</a></h3>

You will nearly always find one of two types of horizontal output transistors
in TVs and monitors:
<p>
</p></li><li>Metal can - TO3 package:
<pre>              _
            / O \         View from bottom (pin side)
          / o   o \
         (  B   E  )      B = Base, E = Emitter, C = Collector
          \       /
            \ O / C       The metal case is the Collector.

</pre>
<p>
</p></li><li>Plastic tab - TO3Pn (n = several suffixes) package:
<p>
</p><pre>            _____
           /     \
          |   O   |      View from front (label side)
          |       |
          |       |      B = Base, E = Emitter, C = Collector
          |_______|
            | | |        If there is an exposed metal tab, this is the
            | | |         Collector as well.
            B C E
</pre>
<p>
Some other transistor types use the same pinout (TO66 for metal can, TO218
and TO220 for plastic tab) but not all.  However, for horizontal output
transistors, these pinouts shouuld be valid.
</p><p>
Note that those with a built in damper diode may read around 50 ohms between
B and E (near 0 on the diode test range) - this is normal as long as the
resistance is not really low like under 10 ohms.

</p><h3><a name="tvhdylthot">How do you locate the HOT</a></h3>

Well, it is usually the LARGEST transistor in the set near the LARGEST
transformer in the set (flyback - the thing with the FAT red wire connecting
to the picture tube) on the LARGEST heat sink in the set.
<p>
Got that? :-)
</p><p>
Or, in the good old days....
</p><p>
(From: Don Wall (d.wall@nunet.neu.edu).)
</p><p>
Sure, it's usually the largest tube in the set, has a top cap, runs very hot,
and is often a 6BQ6G or some such.  (tongue firmly in cheek) Actually, back in
the days of yore, the Horizontal Output Tube was frequently referred to as the
HOT; guess some things don't change!

</p><h3><a name="tvrepptwt">Replacement power transistors while testing</a></h3>

During testing of horizontal deflection circuits or switchmode power supplies,
particularly where the original failure resulted in the death of the HOT or
chopper, overstress on replacement transistors is always a possibility if all
defective components have not be identified.
<p>
Therefore, using a part with better specifications may save you in the long
run by reducing the number of expensive blown parts.  Once all other problems
have been located and repaired, the proper part can be installed.
</p><p>
However, this is not always going to work.  In a TV and especially a high
performance monitor, the HOT may be closely matched to the drive and output
components of the deflection circuits.  Putting in one with higher Vce, I,
or P specifications may result in overheating and failure due to lower Hfe.
</p><p>
Where possible, a series load like a light bulb can be used limit the maximum
current to the device and will allow you to power the equipment while checking
for other faults.  Some designs, unfortunately, will not start up under these
conditions.  In such cases, substituting a 'better' device may be the best
choice for testing.
</p><p>
(From: Glenn Allen (glenn@manawatu.gen.nz).)
</p><p>
I been repairing SMPS of all types but when I started on those using MOSFETs
I was blowning a few of them when replaced because something else was faulty.
</p><p>
Ever since I have been using a BUZ355 on a heat sink I haven't blown it.  It
is rated at 800 V, 6 A, and 220 W. it is a TO218 case bigger than a T0220.
It seems the higher ratings allows you to do repair where as a something like 
a 2SK1117 or MTP6N60 will just blow.

</p><h3><a name="tvtarhot">Testing of replacement HOTs</a></h3>

The following is useful both to confirm that a substitute replacement HOT is
suitable and that no other circuit problems are still present.  However,
single scan line anomalies (particularly when changing channels and/or where
reception is poor with a TV or when switching scan rates and/or when no or
incorrect sync is present with a monitor) resulting in excessive voltage
across the HOT and instant failure are still possible and will not result
in an HOT running excessively hot.
<p>
(From: Raymond Carlsen (rrcc@u.washington.edu).)
</p><p>
After installing a replacement HOT in a TV set or monitor, I like to check the
temperature for awhile to make sure the substitute is a good match and that
there are no other problems such as a weak H drive signal. The input current
is just not a good enough indicator.  I have been using a WCF (well calibrated
finger) for years. For me, the rule of thumb, quite literally, is: if you can
not hold your finger on it, it's running too hot, and will probably fail
prematurely. Touching the case of the transistor or heat sink is tricky....
</p><p>
Metal case transistors will be connected to the collector and have a healthy
pulse (&gt;1,200 V peak!) and even with plastic case tab transistors, the tab will
be at this potential.  It is best to do this only after the power is off and
the B+ has discharged.  In addition, the HOT may be hot enough to burn you. 
</p><p>
A better method is the use of an indoor/outdoor thermometer. I bought one
recently from Radio Shack for about $15 (63-1009). It has a plastic 'probe' on
the end of a 10' cable as the outdoor sensor. With a large alligator clip, I
just clamp the sensor to the heat sink near the transistor and set up the
digital display near the TV set to monitor the temperature. The last TV I used
it on was a 27" Sanyo that had a shorted H.  output and an open B+ resistor.
Replacement parts brought the set back to life and the flyback pulse looked
OK, but the transistor was getting hot within 5 minutes... up to 130 degrees
before I shut it down and started looking for the cause. I found a 1 uF 160
volt cap in the driver circuit that was open. After replacing the cap, I
fired up the set again and monitored the heat sink as before. This time, the
temperature slowly rose to about 115 degrees and stayed there. I ran the set
all day and noticed little variation in the measurement. Test equipment doesn't
have to cost a fortune. 

</p><h3><a name="tvrryoke">Removing and replacing the deflection yoke</a></h3>

Should you need to remove the deflection yoke on a color CRT, some basic
considerations are advised both to minimize the needed purity and convergence
adjustments after replacement as well as to prevent an unfortunate accident.
<p>
The position and orientation of the yoke (including pitch and yaw) and magnet
assembly (purity and static convergence rings, if used) are critical.  Use
paint or White-Out(tm) to put a stripe across all of the magnet rings so you
will know their exact positions should they accidentally shift later.  If there
are rubber wedges between the yoke and the funnel of the tube, assure that they
are secure.  Tape them to be doubly sure as adhesive on old tape dries up with
age and heat and becomes useless.  This will avoid the need for unecessary
dynamic convergence adjustments after reassembly.
</p><p>
The neck is the most fragile part of the CRT so do not apply any serious
side-ways force and take care not to bend any of the pins when removing and
replacing the CRT socket.
</p><p>
The yoke and purity/static convergence assemblies will be clamped and possibly
glued as well.  However, the adhesive will probably be easily accessible - big
globs of stuff like hot melt glue and/or RTV silicone.  Carefully free the
adhesive from the glass neck of the CRT.  Loosen the clamps and gently wiggle
the magnets and yoke off the neck.  They may appear stuck from age and heat
but should yield with gently persuasion.
</p><p>
Once the yoke is replaced, some fine adjustments of the picture rotation,
purity, and static and dynamic convergence may be needed but hopefully with
your most excellent diagrams, these will be minimal.
</p><p>
Similar comments apply for monochrome CRTs but there are far fewer issues as
the yoke is positioned firmly against the funnel of the CRT and rotation and
centering are usually the only adjustments.  However, there may be magnets
located on swivels or glued to strategic locations on the CRT envelope to
correct for geometric distortion.

</p><h3><a name="tvsoyoke">Swapping of deflection yokes</a></h3>

This should work with identical TVs or monitors.  Your mileage will vary if
you are attempting a swap between monitors with similar specifications.
Chances of success for monitors with widely different screen sizes or scan
rate specifications is close to zero.
<p>
One indication of compatibility problems would be major differences in
resistance readings for the corresponding yoke windings, CRT HV and other
bias levels, etc.
</p><p>
Before you do the transplant, see the section: <a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsoyoke">Swapping
of deflection yokes</a> for procedures and precautions to minimize problems
in realignment.
</p><p>
Make a precise diagram of everything you do.
</p><p>
Keep the purity/static convergence magnet assembly with the original CRT if
possible and install it in the same or as nearly the same position as possible
when you replace it.
</p><p>
Once you are sure of the connections, power it up carefully - there is no
assurance that your yokes are compatible.  A yoke with a much lower resistance
or inductance than the original may overstress components in the power supply.
</p><p>
You will then need to go through all the adjustments starting with purity
and convergence.

</p><h3><a name="tvsocrts">Swapping of CRTs</a></h3>

Given the problems of just replacing a CRT with an identical new one, it isn't
surprising that attempting to substitute a CRT which is not the same type will
result in difficulties - to say the least.  Obviously, the closer in size,
scan rate (for monitors), and deflection angle, the more likely the chances
of success.  Where the alternative is to junk the TV or monitor, it may be
worth a shot - and you may get lucky!
<p>
It may be best to transfer as much as possible with the CRT - yoke and purity
and convergence magnets.  The connectors to the yoke may need to be changed
but this may be the least of your problems.  Difference in yoke impedance and
other characteristics may result in anything from incorrect size to a truly
spectacular melt-down!  The latter is much more likely with SVGA monitors
compared to similar size/deflection angle TVs.
</p><p>
Where the neck size is the same, the yoke can be moved from one CRT to the
other but you will have to do a complete purity and convergence set up and
even then you may have uncorrectable convergence errors.  See the section:
<a href="https://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm#tvsoyoke">Swapping of deflection yokes</a>.
</p><p>
(From: J. G. Simpson (ccjgs@cse.bris.ac.uk).)
</p><p>
Monitors are generally designed by choosing a CRT, then the EHT, then designing
a yoke to scan the CRT, then designing a driver circuit to drive the yoke.
</p><p>
In a CRT test lab it's common to have variable supplies for EHT and other
voltages, a small selection of yokes, and variable amplitude drive circuits.
</p><p>
EHT affects scan sensitivity, brightness, spot size.  You can't get high
brightness and small spot size on a large monitor with 3 kV of EHT.  Virtually
every variable has some effect on convergence.  Spot size is important, in as
much as you want most of it on the phosphor and not the shadow mask.
</p><p>
Provided the neck size is the same you can swap tubes in yokes but don't expect
it to work very well.  Different tube manufacturers may use radically different
gun structures.  A given yoke and its driver may give underscan or overscan and
it's pretty well certain that convergence will be way off.
</p><p>
The military spends a small fortune on trying to get the drop into the yoke and
it flies with no adjustment or convergence CRT.  For the rest of us swapping a
CRT is a pain in the butt.

</p><h3><a name="tvdglue">Decayed glue in electronic equipment</a></h3>

Larger components like electrolytic capacitors are often secured to the
circuit board with some sort of adhesive.  Originally, it is white and
inert.  However, with heat and age, some types decay to a brown, conductive
and/or corrosive material which can cause all sorts of problems including
the creation of high leakage paths or dead shorts and eating away at nearby
wiring traces.
<p>
The bottom line: Most of the time, this stuff serves no essential purpose
anyhow and should be removed.  A non-corrosive RTV or hot-melt glue can be
used in its place if structural support is needed.

</p><h3><a name="tvrepparts">Repair parts sources</a></h3>

For general electronic components like resistors and capacitors, most
electronics distributors will have a sufficient variety at reasonable
cost.  Even Radio Shack can be considered in a pinch.
<p>
However, for consumer electronic equipment repairs, places like Digikey,
Allied, and Newark do not have the a variety of Japanese semiconductors
like ICs and transistors or any components like flyback transformers or
degauss Posistors.

"Salvage King TV and VCR Parts" (2818 Odonnell Street, Baltimore, MD 21224)
 operates also as O'Donnell TV. It has turned
 into a TV/VCR parts boneyard.  Donnie, the owner, will actually dig out a
 chassis from the tons he has and cut out a part for you!  He also rents
 Sams' Photofacts!  It's been a while since I was there so I hope this info
 is still current!"
