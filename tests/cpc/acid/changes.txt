re-verified fdc_seek on d765a

disc\fdc_time
- added timing from end of sector data to end of execution phase with read data
- added timing from end of sector data to end of execution phase with write data
- added timing from overrun triggered to end of execution phase with read data
- added timing from overrun triggered to end of execution phase with write data
- added timing from end of execution phase to result phase with read data
- added timing from end of execution phase to result phase with write data

disc\fdc_seek
- added recal then seek (recalibrate, short wait, then do a seek)
- added check for execution phase not set during seek
- added check for execution phase not set during recalibrate

disc\fdc_read
- added a test to read x bytes and store, then read and ignore bytes to end of sector
- added check for execution phase set during read data
- added check for execution phase set during read deleted
- added check for execution phase not set during read data in dma mode
- added check for execution phase not set during read deleted data in dma mode

disc\fdc_gen
- added ready change during command (write command to fdc read data), turn off disc motor after each command byte)
- added ready change during result (write command to fdc (read data), turn off disc motor after each result byte)
- added check for execution phase not set during sense drive status
- added check for execution phase not set during sense interrupt status
- added check for execution phase set during read id (dma and non-dma)
- added check for execution phase not set during invalid command
