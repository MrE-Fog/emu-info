0 recalibrate test (equipment check after 77 tracks; requires 80 track drive)
1 recalibrate when not ready
2 recalibrate setting side 2
3 seek fdd busy flags in main status register
4 seek fdc busy in main status register
5 seek track (fdd goes busy on same track or not)
6 do a seek, wait for it to finish then do a read (no sense interrupt status used)
7 do a long seek and attempt read data immediately
8 check if fdd busy is cleared after seek without sense interrupt status
9 do a long seek then a short seek on same drive
10 attempt seek when not ready
11 attempt a seek but change ready (I think by turning on/off drive motor)
12 attempt a seek setting side 2
13 do a seek, use sense interrupt status to see it has completed, then do one more sense interrupt status
14 enable motor, wait for ready, turn off and do sense interrupt status
15 read data
16 read data different c value
17 read data different h value
18 read data different n value
19 read data (using dtl)
20 read data with data error
21 read data with not ready
22 read data followed by sense interrupt status
23 read data with eot
24 read data on unformatted track
25 read data no skip
26 read deleted data sectors with skip starts and ends on a deleted data sector
27 read deleted data; only 1 sector and that has data in it
28 read deleted data, first is deleted, second is data
29 read deleted data, first is data, second is deleted, third is data
30 read data, and skip deleted data sectors
31 read data; only 1 sector and that has deleted data in it
32 read deleted data sector using data command
33 read data sector using deleted data command
34 read track: read first sector from track, comparison must succeed
35 read track: read first sector from track, comparison must fail
36 read track: read first sector from track, comparison must fail
37 read track: read more than the number of sectors on the track
38 read track:  EOT is 0
39 read track: see how C,H,R,N in result is generated
40 read track: N is 0, and DTL is !=0, and 1 sector is read
41 read_track10 ?
42 read track unformatted
43 read track with skip
44 read track on deleted data track
45 read track with multi-track (starting side 0)
46 read track with multi-track (starting side 1)
47 read track on track with data error
48 read track on track with data error (read 2 sectors)
49 read track (formatted size 2), N in read track as 3
50 read track but not ready
51 read data: multi-track operation - same id's on side 0 and side 1 (41-49)
52 read data: multi-track operation - different id's on side 0 and side 1 (41-49,1-9)
53 read data: multi-track operation - same id's on side 0 and side 1 (1-9)
54 read data: multi-track operation - start from side 2
55 read data: multi-track operation - eot doesn't exist
56 read data: multi-track operation - small eot (3)
57 read data: multi-track operation - bad cylinder on second side
58 read data: multi-track operation - h is 1 on side 0
59 read data: multi-track operation - h is 0 on side 1
60 read data: multi-track operation - h value is &fe on one side &ff on other
61 read data: read data overrun
