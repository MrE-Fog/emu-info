This directory contains the CPC "Acid tests". A collection of tests to confirm the accuracy of 
Amstrad emulators.

There are tests for all aspects of the CPC, Plus and KC Compact and in addition there are tests
for many devices that can be connected to a real CPC.

Some tests have not been run on a real machine or device because I don't have access to them (e.g. Aleste 520EX).
If you have one of these machines or devices please would you run the test on them and tell me the result?
(Most tests will tell you if they have been tested against a real machine or device).

I am still in the process of updating all tests to make their operation more obvious (CRTC and plus tests have not been updated this time).

The desc.txt file describes the configuration of the computers I ran the tests on so that you can compare
the results on real machines if you wish. If you have a computer with a different configuration and which gives
different results I would be interested to see the results.

You can run buildall.bat to build the binaries and disks for all tests within this folder and all sub-folders.

I have attempted to cover all the hardware of the CPC and devices, including operations that are rarely used
but sometimes triggered accidentally. 

If you have a device that is not tested here but you would like to see it documented and emulated please contact 
me and I will write some tests for it, document it in CPCWiki and emulate it in Arnold. 

Please don't assume the operation of a device even if it seems obvious or the same as another device. A device may have peculiarities and nuances which are not immediately obvious and which may not show up through normal usage, so it's best to test it to confirm it or not.

Thank you
