These files can be used to test if an emulator can accept ROM images of
various lengths, with and without an amsdos header and if they are longer than expected.

longhdr.bin - long rom with amsdos header
short.bin - short rom (<16384 bytes)
shorthdr.bin - short rom with amsdos header
shortextra.bin - short rom (<16384 bytes with extra data on the end)
norm.bin - normal rom (16384 bytes exactly)
normextra.bin - normal rom (with extra data on the end)
normhdr - normal rom with amsdos header
longextra - long rom (>16384 with extra bytes on the end)
